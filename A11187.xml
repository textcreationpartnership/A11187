            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>M.r <hi>William Richworth</hi> borne in <hi>Lincolneshire</hi> ſtudied in the English College at <hi>Doway,</hi> there was made Prieſt, and afterwards diſcharged the place and office of <hi>Prefect</hi> with much commendation, all which time he was knowne by the name of Charles Roſſe. Comming into England he liued in diuers places with good esteeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the yeare <hi>1637</hi> in which he dyed. He was a man curious in <hi>Diuinitie, Controuerſies, Mathematikes,</hi> and <hi>Phyſicke,</hi> but cheefely delighted in <hi>Mathematickes,</hi> and by the name of Robinſon entertained correſpondence with the learned <hi>Oughtred.</hi> He affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the rigor of mathematicall diſcourſe euen in his controuerſies, as you may
<pb facs="tcp:16777:3"/>
perceiue by this worke, and thought no man truly learned but who aymed to doe the like. Theſe Dialogues he framed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me yeares agone, and shewed them to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall friends of his, which finding they gaue content to diuers iudicious perſons, he intended to enlarge and publish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but hindered by ſome occaſions ſo that he could not finish and perfect them before his death, he bequeathed his papers and this charge to a friend, to whom he had often communicated his deſigne. Here now you haue them deuided into three parts, The firſt containing and declaring how, and what points of controuerſies are of neceſsitie, The ſecond shewing that ſcripture alone is not a fitt iudge nor able of it ſelf to decide controuerſies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, The third and laſt demonstrate's an euident and infalible meanes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining and deciding all queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and diſputs of faith and Religion, which God grant may be to your profit.</p>

agree in a thing (to wit in a mutually acknowledged he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon rule) which is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cauſes of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir diſagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and therefore their diſageement is only for a time, vntill that head and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le haue a conuenient and fitt opportunitie to reduce the diſagreers to a full and totall agreement.

after they haue heard and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now therefore ſithence in our caſe there is no meanes for anie man to preuaile againſt the Clergie (whom we ſuppoſe agreed amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in anie pointe or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) but by making the laietie iudges thereof, t'is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that it wilbe ſtill againſt reaſon for anie man to attempt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating of anie new pointe or poſition againſt the Clergie's

common verdict, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent, And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an obligation of reaſon and conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce not to doe it.

And becaus the firſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were called in that manner by Chriſt and his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Ego vos elegi de mundo,</hi> therefore we properly and deſeruedly call the multitude of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a <hi>Church.</hi> Now a multitude <hi>called to gether,</hi> is not only and ſimply a multitude, (which may importe confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) but a multitude gathered together and vnited.<note place="margin">wherein conſiſt's the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the church.</note> If you aske wherein this multitude, we ſpeake of, is vnited, t'is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16777:56"/>
knowne that t'is to doe the will of the caller, who being <hi>Ieſus,</hi> (that is, <hi>ſauiour</hi> or <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> to ſaluation) their calling muſt be to walke the paths of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, And ſithence we haue no other Maiſter of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> t'is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the vnitie of his church muſt conſiſte in the obſeruance of his law. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> you are to note, that there are two ſortes of vnities, the one of ſimilitude, the other of connection. We ſaie, all men are of one nature, that's an vnitie of ſimilitude, we ſaie likewiſe, all the parts of a man (though diſlike in themſelues) make one man, there's an vnitie of connectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now if the church of Chriſt had beene to continue only
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16777:57"/>
for his owne, or his Apoſtle's time, the former vnitie would haue ſerued. Nay euen now, if all the Chriſtians, who liue at this day, <hi>doe,</hi> and <hi>performe</hi> the ſame things, practize the ſame faith and good life, and vſe the ſame Sacraments, This <hi>vnitie</hi> of ſimilitude would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to make the church of Chriſt <hi>one</hi> for the preſent, but could not make it ſubſiſte and continue, there being no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection amongſt the parts and members of this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to make them ſticke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Wherefore Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing planted a multitude of faithfull which he intended should ſubſiſte and continue for manie ages, no doubt but he hath giuen them ſuch an <hi>vnitie</hi> as is neceſſarie for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16777:57"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> therefore you muſt note that there are two ſortes of multitudes in this world which ſubſiſte and continue, the one naturall, as the parts of a liuing creature, the other morall as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of communities or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and both haue their proportionall vnities. For the firſt we ſee that in plantes all the members haue a due connection to the roote, from which being cutt of the part dyeth for want of continuitie. In other liuing creatures we likewiſe finde at hart (or ſome thing elſe that ſupplie's it's function) by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherevnto euerie part receiueth life and ſubſiſtence, and whoſe paſſage or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with that hart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16777:58"/>
ſtopped and cutt off, the part by litle and litle fade's and dye's. For the ſecond ſubſiſting and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, we ſee in all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or common wealths there is a <hi>head, common Councell,</hi> or <hi>higheſt authoritie,</hi> wherevnto all the members repaire in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, and by their conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therewith, they receiue <hi>ſecuritie, life,</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> in that morall kinde of being, euerie man doing his dutie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the lawes of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie, and the <hi>head</hi> or <hi>ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me authoritie</hi> prouiding for the obſeruance of the lawes in generall, and particularly for the direction of ſuch caſes as the lawes reach not vnto. So that if you take awaie this <hi>head</hi> or <hi>common wiſdome,</hi> the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16777:58"/>
muſt of neceſſitie be short liued, and quickly come to ruine. Hence it is euident to common ſenſe and naturall reaſon, that the church of Chriſt being a multitude or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſubſiſte and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, muſt not only haue the <hi>vnitie of ſimilitude</hi> and be <hi>one</hi> by the ſimilitude of actions which Chriſt hath preſcribed, and all Chriſtians practize; but alſo by the vnitie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection to ſome common <hi>head</hi> and <hi>ſupreme Councell,</hi> whereby it may conſerue it ſelfe, and keepe it's ſubiects in the continuance of the law of Chriſt, and in the practize of thoſe actions which he hath commanded.

But our Chriſtian law being aboue nature, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly not to be learned by man's iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but by authoritie, (that is by receiuing it from Chriſt) thoſe who doe not receiue it by that <hi>meanes</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> by which Chriſt hath ordained it shall be receiued, are not truly of this communitie, whatſoeuer be their materiall beliefe and opinion. Wherefore you are to conſidere farther, that this <hi>Receipte</hi> of Chriſt's law and doctrine may haue beene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Chriſt himſelf to be effected two ſeuerall waies.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16777:62"/>
is, that this law and doctrine should be vocally taught and deliuered from hand to hand, from father to ſonne to the world's end: ſecondly, by writing. Now therefore if Chriſt haue ordained both theſe waies, who should not accept of them both, is not truly and properly a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor conſequently of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian communitie. If Chriſt haue only inſtituted <hi>tradition</hi> to be the meanes and rule of the <hi>receite</hi> of his law and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and hath giuen <hi>ſcripture</hi> only for ſuperabundant inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and conſolation, then who should reiect <hi>tradition,</hi> and flye to the <hi>ſcripture,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it his only <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> of <hi>receiuing</hi> Chriſt's law and doctrine, were not truly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16777:63"/>
and properly a Chriſtian, nor of the Chriſtian communitie.

                     </note> In the interim you may inferre out of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to our preſent pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>three things</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make one a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Chriſtian, and ſuch an
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16777:63"/>
one, as euerie Chriſtian ought to bee, if he will be truly one of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and church of Chriſt. Though perhaps one may be in ſome ſorte a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and goe to heauen too, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttaordinarie meanes, without hauing all theſe three ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſpoſitions and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The firſt is, that he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue and practize the law of God, which in reſpect of a particular man is but short, and t'is, in a word, to loue God aboue all things. The ſecond is, that he be vnited to the multitude of true Chriſtians, that is, that he depende of the Gouerment left and inſtituted by Chriſt here vpon earth. And for this pointe or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as I doubt not but ſome
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16777:64"/>
one or few may be ſaued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it (yea peraduenture with an oppoſition to it in fact through ignorance, ſo his hart be true and without paſſion) yet to thinke this a common, ordinarie, and high waie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and that t'is as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to liue from vnder this Gouerment ſetled by Chriſt, as vnder it, were ridiculous and abſurde in common ſenſe and reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and in deede it were to annultate Chriſt's coming, and make his law voide and fruitleſſe. And if you deſire to conceiue the neceſſitie of this pointe more fully, doe but reflect and conſidere the nature of all ciuill and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call commonwealths, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if anie member doe not liue vnder the Gouernors,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16777:64"/>
and depende of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats eſtablished by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt power and authoritie the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, he cannot be truly and properly ſaid to be a part and member of that communitie, nor can he aſſuredly know (ordinarily ſpeaking) nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly performe the law and orders of it. The third pointe is, that this communitie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof euerie particular Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be a share and member, hath the true <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> to know and obſerue the law of Chriſt. And it is neceſſarie that this pointe be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly knowne by thoſe who liue amongſt diuerſitie of opinions in this matter. For where there appeares learned and morally good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking parts in this queſtion, a priuat
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16777:65"/>
man ſeeme's to haue iuſt reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doubt whether ſide he shall take for his guide, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this pointe well dicuſſed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt ſuch, giue's a man full and generall ſatisfaction for his whole beliefe and practize. And theſe two laſt pointes cleere one the other, for that communitie which hath the true meanes of the <hi>receipte</hi> of Chriſt's law and doctrine, that is, the <hi>true rule of faith,</hi> muſt of neceſſitie be it, of, and <hi>in</hi> which we are to ſeeke, and shall finde, Chriſt's law: And contrariewiſe if we finde the true communitie, we are ſure it hath the true <hi>rule</hi> of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt's law and doctrine. Hence it is that the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke church euer preſſed hir Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries with two ſpeciall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16777:65"/>
1. with the <hi>noueltie</hi> of their church, shewing that none of them euer had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall viſible ſucceſſion. 2. that they receiue not their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions from their Anceſtors, and by them from Chriſt, but that they were inuented at ſuch a time, againſt the receiued <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> of the church in that time, that is, traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the church, and noueltie of doctrine in hir Aduerſaries.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly this rule of ours tell's vs, that Proteſtant's negatiue poſitions are againſt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good of the multitude of Chriſtians, that is, againſt charitie, and God's law, hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them from diuers impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and neceſſarie meanes conducing to ſaluation.

out of paſſion and reuenge, then out of anie rationall loue and knowing zeale to God and Religion. And now, cozen, I hope you conceiue the extreme neceſſitie and maine importance of theſe pointes which we haue talked of, being ſuch as that the church of God cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte without them, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to Chriſt's coming, <hi>to witt,</hi> to eſtablish <hi>ſome</hi> to haue the charge and care of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gouerning his church, And that theſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Gouernors haue great credit and authoritie, euen ſupernaturall and more then human, And that their iudgment in matters of beliefe and Religion is to ſtand good, nor may be ſubiected to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16777:73"/>
weake and wauering iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the laietie, that is of men ignorant in the principles of their ſcience and diſcipline: And laſtly that being thus vnited they haue the true and right <hi>rule</hi> of knowing Chriſt's law, and thoſe things which are to be belieued and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. All which you ſee are of that nature, that the verie eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Chriſtian church and communitie cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte and continue without anie of them all, And without ſuch a church the Generalitie of mankinde cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in charitie, nor without charitie arriue to eternall Happineſſe, for which both charitie and all theſe other pointes are abſolutly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This hath beene the

But me thinke's it were a hard caſe to depriue anie man of that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and qualitie, without which he cannot abſolutly attaine to his end, that others may come to their ends with greater eaſe and ſecuritie. And therefore I should thinke that no other

                  <p>I confeſſe I ſee myne ouerſight, for truly the church is bound in ſuch a caſe to proceede with rigor, And the partie which will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcende to helpe the frailtie of their breetheren, doth by this very fact deſerue to looſe the protection of charitie, which it willfully abandon's, And in effect ſuch a partie hath alreadie putt it ſelfe out of the ſecret communitie of God's church, and the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is only to performe it in externall apparence.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16777:76"/>
vpon pride and faction to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their opinion, And that they trench vpon the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ordained by Ieſus Chriſt, them ſelues not being caled therevnto, proudly ſetting themſelues in the ſeate of iudgment to determine what's fitt and conuenient for the whole Chriſtian communitie, and ſtrugling to force their opinions vpon the church againſt the ſentence of the churche's Gouernors, which ſurely ought to preuaille in ſuch a caſe. Looke but into the exemples of anie polliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call common wealth, and ſee what inequalitie there is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt twelue pence and a man's life, and yet our laws ordaine the loſſe of life for the ſtealth of a shilling or there abouts,

This then being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I doubt not but you will grant likewiſe that in a church, <hi>vertue</hi> is to be engendred and conſerued with great care and diligence, And although the ſame things which firſt breede pietie and deuotion doe afterwards conſerue it, yet may there be ſome things more proper for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation then for the breeding of it, and contrariewiſe others more proper for breeding then conſeruing it, according as the different ſtate of anie thing that growe's towards
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16777:77"/>
perfection doth require a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers care and attendance. Tell me then, cozen, how thinke you is the breeding of <hi>vertue</hi> performed in man kinde?

                  <p>Sithence vertue is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the loue of what is truly good for man, and that we cannot loue what we know not, <hi>vertue</hi> muſt needes be cheefly increaſed by cleerely ſeeing and often thinking of the <hi>thing</hi> we ought to loue, and of ſuch things as belong vnto it, and make it appeare worthie of loue, Amongſt which one is, that it be in our power to obtaine it.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16777:78"/>
vpon I ſee that the breeding of vertue conſiſteth in three things, <hi>often thinking of it's obiect, highly eſteeming of it,</hi> and <hi>conceiting it to be poſsible.</hi> Which correſponde's to the three ſtepps and degrees, you made, of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to anie good.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16777:78"/>
For the firſt you haue heard I am ſure how God Allmightie in the old law would haue men's harts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually buſied about his law, how he would haue them to thinke of it at home and vpon the high waie, morning and euening, how he would haue his comandments bound to their hands, and ſo euer wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging before their eyes, and written vpon the frontiſpice of their houſes. All which was to ſignifie that the memorie of God's law could not be too great, being not ſufficient to thinke of it in the church only, or at vacant times from neceſſarie labours, but that our thoughts ought euer to be imployed that waye. The like doth the Catholike church,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16777:79"/>
cauſing to be erected vpon the highwaies, in market-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in corners of ſtreetes ſome times croſſes with our ſauiour's image nailed vpon them, ſome times his flagella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his coronation, his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, his aſcention or ſome other myſterie of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or pious repreſentation, to putt vs in minde of what ought to moue vs to the loue of God, which are frequently to be ſeene in Catholike coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in euerie houſe, in euerie roome, ouer euerie dore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof there be yet ſome mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes in our owne Countrie. And can you thinke that this diligence of our forefathers compared to thoſe comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of God Allmightie in the old law, to be ouer much? Or that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16777:79"/>
the zeale of thoſe who pulled downe theſe memories of Chriſtianitie was according to ſcience? Doth not the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this pointe cleerely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the increaſe of vertue, and the churches Gouerment? Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely it doth. For I thinke no wiſe and indifferent man can doubt but that pictures muſt needes breede manie good thoughts which would neuer haue beene without them. What true Chriſtian can looke vpon the repreſentation of anie bloodie paſſage of our ſauiour's paſſion, but he will be moued to ſome good thought or ſentiment if he haue anie feeling of Chriſtianitie in him? Or if ſome be not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to pious thoughts by ſuch an obiect, will not manie
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16777:80"/>
others be? And none can doubt but that from ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout thoughts doe naturally proceede and floe manie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous affections, and theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections doe engender perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it being their connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall leauings and effect, And this perfection is <hi>that</hi> which ſaueth our ſoules. So that you ſee ſome come to ſaluation, others to a higher degree of perfection, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently of Bliſſe, by the vſe of pictures. Where by the waye you may note that if pictures haue this effect in our ſoules, to what degree of reuerence and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will not the bleſſed Sacre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe raiſe them who truly and aſſuredly belieue Chriſt's reall, corporall, and ſubſtantiall preſence to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16777:84"/>
of errour and harme which may come thereby. For euerie diſcreete man knowes well that man's nature is ſubiect to doe it ſelf miſcheefe euen by the beſt things. How dull and blockish, and how nothing better then the ſtocke or ſtone it ſelf which he admire's, muſt that man be (if he haue but had anie indifferent inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſtianitie) who can be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leeue that a piece of wood or marble is that <hi>God and man</hi> whom he hath heard prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to haue beene borne, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and dyed vpon a croſſe, and now to raigne in heauen?

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16777:85"/>
to be mended, not the vſe of pictures taken awaie, which doe vniuerſally good, though ſome particular harmes come by their occaſion from n other cauſe. Wherefore the Greeke Eperour had donne more wiſely to haue punished ſeuerely thoſe impoſtors, then to haue taken awaie ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of deuotion. And this ſame anſwere may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed whith conuenient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to thoſe people who are ſo zealous towards their old pictures.

that if anie tell you the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent vſe of pictures make's them to be of litle or no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, your anſwere is radie, that the like may be ſaid as well of thoſe common and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent meanes which God Allmightie ordained in the old law to put men in minde of his commandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as alſoe of anie other meanes how ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious ſoeuer, to witt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, prayer, frequentation of the Sacrements and the like, if they be commonly vſed and practized.

we ſee that all the dangers of the ſea and warrs, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing into the bottome of the Ocean, and deluing to the center of the earth, hanging on ropes and ſcaffolds, and what ſoeuer man hath inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this kinde doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre men, where there is ether <hi>profit</hi> or <hi>Admiration.</hi> Let but one deſperate <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> shew the waie, and he will not want multitudes of follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, ſo ether vanitie or gaine ſecond his aduentures.

                  <p>You remember I propoſed vnto you but now a diuiſion of ſome things which concerned the bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, others the conſeruation of vertue and deuotion. For although ſuch things as aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vertue doe likewiſe of neceſſitie conſerue it, yet there may be ſome things which properly are to conſerue it, and not to augment it, or at leaſt of two things which doe both, the one may conſerue it becauſe it breed's it, the other may augment it becauſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue's it. Now therefore if we finde anie thing whoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall effect is only to hinder ſuch contrarieties as would
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16777:92"/>
diſtroye pietie and deuotion, ſuch, properly ſpeaking, doe not augment it of them ſelues, but yet they may be truly ſaid to conſerue it. Farther if you conſidere you shall finde that this hindering of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarieties and oppoſites to vertue is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed two waies. Firſt by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing all ſuch things as put men in feare of yeilding to the contrarie, which is a kinde of ſtrengthening of man's we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akneſſe againſt theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Secondly by diminishing and aſwaging the force and violence of theſe contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ether in them ſelues, or in their action. In the firſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doe contribute all kinde of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and particularly thoſe which are vſed in the inſtalements and Beginnings
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16777:92"/>
of offices and charges, as the Sacraments of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie.</hi> And likewiſe the opinion of miracles. For <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> their nature in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is to put in men's heads the conceite of a high and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime thing, whereby we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede with greater caution and warineſſe in the buſines which we haue in hand. And for <hi>miracles,</hi> the beliefe and opinion of them once well grounded (as it ought to be) make's the people extremely apprehenſiue of the preſence of Almightie God, and of his immediate gouerment of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affaires. So that as to be ouer credulous of miracles is the ſigne of a light and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man (for according to reaſon the ſtranger the thing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16777:93"/>
is, the greater ought to be the proofe which should make vs belieue it) ſo likewiſe not to thinke that ſome miracles in common haue beene and are now done in the Catholike church, were to contradict the vniuerſall and conſtant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all good Chriſtians, and deſerue's to be ſuſpected of not belieuing the particular prouidence of Allmightie God; which is the maine ſtring where vpon all Chriſtianitie and ſupernaturall Religion ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth, and which all Maiſters of pietie and deuotion haue euer souht to grounde ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

procreation of children vpon his ſeruants as a cheefe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Bleſſing, ſo we ſee in Abraham and in the good woman that entertained Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus; and ſuerly it was the firſt Bleſſing that God beſtowed vpon his creatures. If you conſidere for what end God ſanctifie's anie action, you shall finde t'is only for man's vſe, And then reflect vpon the <hi>goods</hi> which follow the lawfull vſe of this materiall action betwixt man and wife, and you will not wonder that God hath placed a Sacrament in matrimonie. I doe not doubt but the light of reaſon tell's you, that in reſpect of good oeconomie a man's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but one wife, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall cohabitation with hir,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16777:94"/>
is the beſt manner of ſecular liuing that can be, both for temporalities ſake, and for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a quiet and contented life. Which ſuppoſed, Mariage muſt needes be a matter of great conſideration. For ether a man muſt liue without a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (which kinde of life is but for few) or with this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after he hath once taken hir, And therefore t'is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance that this manner of life of it's owne nature be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and gratfull. Beſides you know a man take's a great deale of naturall content in his wife, generally ſpeaking, (which ſome times drawe's him to ſtrang inconueniences, vnleſſe his paſſions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be well moderated and ſetled) for you know hee take's
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16777:95"/>
hir for his beſt friend, his beſt ſeruant, and his deareſt partner in all his buſineſes, ſuppoſing she be wiſe and prudent, and conſequently euer complying in reaſon with hir husband's humour. Whereby you ſee that the making of a Marriage, and the vſage of it when t'is made, is the pinne whereon doth hang the cheefe content and ſweetneſſe of a maried man's life, the good of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, the maine ſucceſſe and proſperitie of his temporall eſtate or fortunes, And aboue all the breeding of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the inſtilling of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vertue into their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der harts, which may grow with their age and carie them to felicitie.

And laſtly the verie conceite of chaſtitie and the ſollitude or loneneſſe of an vnmarried man, breedeth an apprehenſion of the perſon in whom they are, whereby
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16777:104"/>
the people are much better gouerned by ſuch an one. Nor is Celebate the cauſe of ſuch diſorders, as truly are found in ſome places too frequent; but the multiplication of Prieſts.

                  <p>I haue heard manie ſaie ſo too, but they did not conſidere that the neceſſitie of Gouerment and inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the cheefe neceſſitie of the church, and that the Clergie is made and inſtituted for this Gouerment (hauing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts pourpoſly reſerued vnto them to procure them veneration and authoritie for the better performance thereof) and therefore not anie one ought to be made Prieſt, but for this end, to witt, for the neceſſitie of inſtruction and Gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And this Bishops ought to take care of, nor to beſtow
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16777:105"/>
Prieſthood but where the man's creation is neceſſarie for his flocke, and then Prieſts would liue better and be more honored. This was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize of the primitiue church, vntill the Ambition of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons (who had the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the church in their hands) made them deſire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſo were made Prieſts. And the like ambition I belieue was the inuentor of thoſe faire reaſons which you alledge, for well may it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence in a Prince to haue manie ſeruants, but to haue manie cheefe heads and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors that muſt needes leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen their eſteeme. And for hearing of Maſſes, if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be well ordered and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned few Prieſts will ſuffice,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16777:106"/>
nor is the inconuenience ſo great as the multiplicitie of Prieſts. And the like may be ſaid for the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and for the helping of both liuing and dead by the holy ſacrifice of the Altar. As for thoſe who deſire to be Prieſts out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, I thinke their deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would be more conformable to the pietie of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if they did rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides the Clergie not making anie vowe or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of renouncing ether riches or honor, and bearing the greateſt charge and office in the common wealth, t'is both fitting and neceſſarie that they haue ſo much wealth as is requiſite for the due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their function, as, firſt to be out of ſollicitude for conuenient mantenance, 2. to haue an equall conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with their ſubiects, 3. to giue example of the due and true vſe of wealth, and 4. to breede a conuenient reſpecte of their qualitie and perſons in thoſe whom they are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne by their perſuaſions and authoritie.

You will ſaie perhapps that the Clergie's authoritie ought to be grounded vpon their learning,<note place="margin">Why the Clergie ought to haue Wealth beſides vertue.</note> wiſdome, and cheefely vpon their vertue.

For their ſubiects being bound vnder paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obey their ſuperiour in anie thing that is not manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinne, it giue's the ſuperiour a mightie commande ouer the whole bodie (ſpecially if it be purely monarchicall and that one man gouerne all) and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby a maine power to ſwaye gteat multitudes at his will and pleaſure. And I heard not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g agoe an able man, (who hath beene imployed of late by our ſtate in Catholike Countries) ſaie, that Princes ſome times were vehemently affraid of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16777:109"/>
their puiſſant combinations, and held it no ſmale point of pollicy to imploye and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge Religious orders in their intereſts of ſtate. Whereas for the Clergie they feared them not, hauing no ſuch obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of obedience amongſt them, but only according to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> nor anie dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of forraine ſtates, but euerie man for him ſelfe and therefore vnable to doe the ſtate anie great ether ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice or preiudice by anie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious intelligence abroad.</p>

                  <p>Lord! coſen, how different is the truth from the common opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world. The truth is, coſen, Religious men are gouerned by vowes and rules or conſtitutions, their vowes make them Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16777:110"/>
their rules are directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for their, liuing in peace and vertue. Their vowe of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which you ſpeake of, reacheth only to the ſpirituall education and progreſſe of their ſubiects, their rules are for the reſt. If their vowes did reach to their temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, then I confeſſe they were no Religious vowes but were to be ſuſpected of factious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>binations, and both church and ſtate might and would be jealous of them, but t'is not ſo, and therefore they are lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and no waies hurtfull in a common wealth. And for the Religious man's rule, which only, and not his vowe bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de's him to all temporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, t'is of no great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nay ſome of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16777:110"/>
that their rule obligeth not in conſcience (as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and ciuil law doth) no not vnder a veniall ſinne. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee t'is farr from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion to patronize anie banding againſt ether church or ſtate, and ſo farr that euerie Deuine will tell you, that obedience in ſuch a caſe is damnable both to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander and obeyer. Nay they will tell you that if anie Religious order were come to that height of ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which God forbid) as to bend their aymes and endeauours gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to the preiudice of the church or ſtate, ſeeking to to ruine the antie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and lawfull gouerment of ether of them, to ſett vp their owne, that in ſuch a caſe it were a ſinne to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16777:111"/>
enter into anie ſuch order, and that the vowes of ſuch as should be alreadie profeſſed therin would not oblige the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obedience, nor could ſuch a inſtitute be truly eſteemed a Religious inſtitute. And now I hope you are fully ſatisfied. I know there be diuers obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s beſides theſe which you produce, but ether they pitch vpon abuſes in ſtead of vſes, as theſe doe, or else they ayme to take awaie the ſubſtance of a <hi>thing,</hi> becauſe of ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall harmes which fall out in the vſe and practize of it. As if one should forbid iron tooles by reaſon ſome times there happene's miſcheefe by them, not weighing the vtilitie with the harme. Wherefore the Proteſtants, what ſoeuer
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16777:111"/>
they hold, and ſaie that they doe not condemne Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes (which according to there rule of th' <hi>Errabilitie</hi> of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and of the libertie they aſſume vnto them ſelues, they are bound to doe) yet in effect and in practize they doe it, And muſt needes or else de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte their pretences and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with the Catholike church at the verie beginning. For example if Luther or Caluin were vrged, Is the vſe of reuerencing pictures Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie or no? They muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie anſwere <hi>yes,</hi> or else they are convinced to breake from the preſent church (whereof they are yet apart) without a ſufficient cauſe. If they be farther preſſed, Can you euidently conuince that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:16777:112"/>
t'is idolatrie? or may it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bablely ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained that t'is not? If they acknowledge they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, then they are oppreſſed againe, If it be but peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yes, peradua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture no, why doe you make a ſchiſme and diuiſion in the church, and not ſubmitte your ſelues to the beliefe of your forefathers and of the preſent vniuerſall church? If they reply that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nether part is certaine, then each one may hold what he thinke's fitt. You vrge them againe, is this your reply cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine? can you conuince it euidently? or is it but only probable? if only probable, they are ſtill in the ſame ſnare, if certaine and euident, they might haue ſaid ſo of the firſt propoſition. But in deede it
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:16777:112"/>
were againſt common ſenſe and too ridiculous for anie priuat man to vndertake to make an Euident conuiction and demonſtration againſt the generall beliefe of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall church for ſo manie ages. And thus you ſee that theſe men who cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince anie thing againſt the Arrians, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Pelagians, Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and the like (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned manie yeares agoe by the Catholike church) and thinke all probable that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of learned and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent men haue doubted of, yea vſe this for a maxime that ſuch pointes muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be doubted of, as being not with in the reach of euident conuiction, Let but, I ſaie, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe men come to write againſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16777:113"/>
Catholikes, and you shall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue them pretende whole liſtes of demonſtrations, and whole pages will not ſuffice to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp the abſurdities which they imagine doe follow out of ſome one Catholike poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, ſo neceſſarie it is that theſe men contradict them ſelues who contradict the truth of Chriſt and his church.</p>

For if the Catholike church doth eſſentially ſubſiſte and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hir ſelfe vpon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and grounde, that she hath receiued hir doctrine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt by word of mouth and ſucceſſion from hand to hand which cannot faile, put the caſe she yeilde's to the church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in anie poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te which she holdeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this principle, is it not euident that she muſt of neceſſitie forgoe

what church ſoeuer doth not thinke hir ſelfe <hi>vnerrable</hi> in anie pointe, what she holdeth may be falſe, and therefore it were temeritie for ſuch a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch to hold anie pointe certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely true, And if she hold not anie pointe certainely true, why should not the verie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſtate and intereſt ſeeke to haue them changed and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled ſecure and infalible, ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

his reaſon, And that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and force of Experience doth conuince moſt euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that there is no Gouerment in a church without preſcribing of ſome <hi>tenets</hi> and forbidding of others (reſtraining or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, if neede be, ſuch as wil not complie with thoſe preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or articles) And that t'is likewiſe euident that this is contrarie to the libertie of opinion which the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t putte's for his firſt and cheefe maxime to approue his ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Roman church; will it not follow with out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that ether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants muſt breake with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the nature of man, in holding libertie in their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and vnderſtandings, and obliging to obedience in
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16777:116"/>
their will and practize: Or els they muſt cloſe with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church in their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and profeſſe the <hi>inerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,</hi> of the church, at leaſt ſo farr as obligeth hir ſubiects not to withſtand or oppoſe, but to ſubmitte and obey hir Canons and comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des.

                  <p>It is verie true. I will tell you therefore, cozen, how the authoritie of the ſcripture, that is,<note place="margin">Now the neW Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Was pro aga ted.</note> of the new Teſtament, came into the church. An Apoſtle or Diſciple writing a booke or Epiſtle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated it to that church or Countrie wherein he preached or to which he writte it, that church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16777:123"/>
it to their neighbours as the worke of ſuch an Apoſtle, ſo by litle and litle it grew fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one countrie to an other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it was ſpredd ouer the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Chriſtian world. So that ſome countries had not the new Teſtament complete, (that is, all the bookes of it) for a long time. Wherefore no wonder that ſome haue doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſeuerall parts thereof, being not able to auerre, as not aſſured (by reaſon of ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident) that ſuch bookes were truly the workes of ſuch an Apoſtle or Diſciple, which not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,<note place="margin">Why the canon of ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is chee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fely to be had from Rome.</note> better intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce being gotten might be after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards receiued for ſcripture.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16777:125"/>
haue more certaintie: but where both are equaly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the ſame Apoſtle to the ſame church, I should thinke the worke should haue more authoritie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word.

                  <p>If the queſtion be but of a particular church or Prouince, I doubt it will not be ſufficient to giue vs a firme authoritie for ether one or the other, vnleſſe we add more circumſtances then we haue declared. And the reaſon is, becauſe one Prouince maye haue had Religion ſo ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it by the incurſion of infidells, that recouering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues after a long time they
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16777:125"/>
may as well miſtake one booke for an other, as one doctrine for an other, and ſo this point is not much to our pourpoſe. Although euen in this caſe the doctrine taught by word of mouth hath theſe aduantages. That it is deliuered to manie, the booke to few, or in ſome one place. The doctrine heard and vnderſtood by manie, the booke only to ſuch as can reade, nor to all them nether, but to ſuch as are carefull. The booke belonge's not much to the practize of the multitude, the doctrine gouernes their whole liues. The booke brought often times by ſome one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as ſome meſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger if it be an Epiſtl, or other wiſe ſent from ſome other place or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome one perſon, as from
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16777:126"/>
Titus of Timotheus, to whom it was firſt written, and vpon whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie only the whole veritie muſt originally rely. But to returne to our caſe. Doe you not ſee that the whole church truſteth ſome one particular man at the firſt vpon whom she buildeth hir beliefe tht this is ſuch an Apoſtles worke, that is, <hi>ſcripture?</hi> But for anie materiall point of doctrine she relyeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vniuerſall knowledge of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who heard it preached in diuers parts of the world. So that, as I doe not intende to ſay, the one is certaine, the other not, (for a particular churche's authoritie may be certaine in ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtances) yet I muſt needes ſay that betwixt theſe two cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16777:126"/>
there is ſuch a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that if the one were to bring in verdict vpon the other, it would be much more forcible and euident to conclude, that this booke is ſcripture, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe it is according and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the doctrine taught and preached, then that this doctrine is the Apoſtle's, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is conformable to this booke. For if it be true, that the whole church once relyed vpon ſome one particular church for this veritie, it can neuer come to paſſe that the certaintie of this booke proue greater then was the authoritie of that particular church at that time, And conſequently the ſame compariſon which is to be made betwixt the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of this particular church
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16777:127"/>
and of the vniuerſall church, the ſame, I ſay, is to be made betwixt the certaintie of this booke's being ſcripture, and of this point of doctrine's being catholike and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. And for the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce you were jealous of, it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out quitt contrarie. For whether we conſidere the inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration and aſſiſtance of the holy ghoſt, or the induſtrie aed carefullneſſe of man, you shall euer finde that the end is more principally aymed at, then the meanes to compaſſe the end, and likewiſe amongſt diuers meanes the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate to the end is ſtill moſt aymed at, wherefore in our caſe the end both of writing and ſpeaking being the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of this doctrine for the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16777:127"/>
good of the people, no doubt, I ſay, but that both the Aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the holy ghoſt, and the care of man tendeth more principally to the deliuerie of this doctrine then to other things that came in by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, in which only there might be a slipp, as you immagine. Wherefore ſithence tradition containeth not all the words the Apoſtles ſpoke, but mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely what belong's to Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine, (which was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deliuered, and the chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe errand of the Apoſtles) and that in the ſcriptute manie things are written vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and as it were by the bye, no doubt but in both theſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, to wit, of the aſſiſtance of the holy ghoſt, and of the care of man, the certaintie will
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16777:128"/>
be greater of the doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by word of mouth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy writt. Beſides the slipps you ſpeake of, are when things are only once deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or ſpoken without great premeditation, whereas this doctrine was a thing perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually beaten on, ſo as there can be no feare of ſuch slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.<note place="margin">HoW the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hands.</note> For the ould Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as I confeſſe t'is poſſible that the Apoſtles might haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered it in all Countries where they preached; ſo likewiſe I thinke t'is euident that they neuer did it, being that the church hath no ſuch memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, And that the Canon hath beene doubted of by ſome, and the Iewish Canon allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, whereof there had beene no vſe nor neede, if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16777:128"/>
had left to all churches the booke it ſelf. It is likely therefore that the ould Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was brought in by the firſt Chriſtians' of the Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, who accepted of thoſe bookes which they ſaw the Apoſtles honnor and make vſe of, and from them it came to the Gentill Chriſtians, and ſo by litle and litle was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by all the Chriſtian church with the ſame venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Apoſtles and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish Chriſtians gaue vnto it.

Which if it were certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, I should eſteeme their tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of as great authoritie as the originall text it ſelf. But we ſee that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Apoſtles time ſome ſought to mende their interpretation, as Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotion and Aquila, whoſe tranſlations were neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe accepted of by the church, and conſerued and eſteemed.

Nay contrariewiſe it is the law of a good tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor not to yeild word for word
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:16777:142"/>

And truly I thinke that euerie one wil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit at leaſt as much differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and varietie betwixt the originall and the tranſlation, as betwixt tranſlation and tranſlation, theſe agreeing in the ſame tongue, thoſe not, and yet hauing all the other reaſons of diſagreeing. And doe you not thinke cozen, that if one should take twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the beſt ſchollers in a ſchoole and giue them an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to tranſlate ether out of latin into English or out of English into latin, that their tranſlations would ſo differ in manie ſentences as that diuers
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16777:143"/>
ſenſes might be eaſily gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of them, And iudge there vpon that when witts are ſett contentiously to diſcuſſe euerie poſſible varietie, what truth can be conuinced where anie two may diſagree, though both acknowledge the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor? An other conſiderable circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance is, that amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt all antient tranſlations none can be reiected, becauſe it may euer be ſuppoſed, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this varietie may proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ede from a various copie out of which they were tranſlated, and by reason we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approue the copie, as wee ſaid before, we cannot therefore likewiſe nether iuſtly nor cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely refuſe the tranſlation, hauing nothing to grounde ſuch refuſall but coniectures
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16777:143"/>
and likelyhoods which be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie imperfect. And if we come to calculate, we may verie well ſuppoſe that there are now ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me twenty tranſlations made into ſeuerall la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guages. I might put more, for there hath bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne peraduenture 200 latin tranſlations, conſidering the greatneſſe of the Roman Empire for ſo manie Ages, and the eſteeme of the booke making euerie man deſirous to haue an exact text, none being as yet euer acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for ſuch, nor anie prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of tranſlating ſcripture. Which varietie of latin tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations the Proteſtants them ſelues acknowledge, and ſaie verie well that they perished after S. Hierome's correction and amendment of the Bible,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16777:144"/>
whoſe complaints of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of texts all the world knowes, and indeede the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utilitie and diſcommoditie of ſuch multiplicitie cauſed them all to be neglected, though ſome thinke our <hi>vulgata edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> to haue euer beene conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Howſoeuer we may goe on with our ſuppoſition, and add, that of thoſe twenty tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s now exta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t euerie one is equall to anie other, Let then a ſentence be propoſed, wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſe nature and definition is to decide a controuerſie, but with this condition, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily happeneth in ſuch a caſe, to witt, that it dependeth on the proprietie of ſome word, or on the Emphaſis of ſome manner of ſpeaking: Is it poſſible that anie reaſonable
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:16777:144"/>
man should thinke that all theſe tranſlations will agree in ſuch a thing? Three or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer peraduenture may, but for twentie t'is abſolutly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, And if anie one of theſe tranſlations be ſubſtantially different all the reſt cannot with certaintie or euidence beare it downe, ſithence this might be out of a different copie with which perhapps agreed more then we haue, ſo that we shall ſtill returne to our former <hi>non liquet.</hi> And hence followeth that although a translation in the whole bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke be morally the ſame booke with the originall, yet meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſically and rigorouſly there is great diuerſitie, and at leaſt <hi>ſuch,</hi> as in our caſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all tranſlations of the

                  <p>I know words are but ſignes of what is in our mindes, ſett and ordained to that ende by the will of man,<note place="margin">wha ars words.</note> and therefore that diuers men ſignifying their mindes by diuers ſignes, come to make diuers languages. And I know likewiſe that though it bee an ordinarie thing amongſt vs to hange vp a bush to ſignifie thereby that in the houſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is wine to be sould, yet peraduenture in an other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye ſome thing else may ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie the ſelling of wine, and a bush ſome other thing. So may it happen that the ſame word in one language may
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:16777:149"/>
ſignifie one thing and in an other, ſome thing else, And becauſe I likewiſe ſee that it may ſo fall out that theſe two nations ioyne in one, or haue much commerce together, by vſe and cuſtome this word may come to haue two ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, euen in the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, And ſo will breede a difficultie in whether of the two ſenſes it is to be taken, which I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue is caled Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation.<note place="margin">The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> And ſithence there is no other grounde for ether of theſe ſignifications but man's will, which cannot be eaſily demonſtrated, I know not well how the truth can bee certainly knowne.</p>

                  <p>You ſaie verie well, for the ſignification of words muſt needes depende of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>'s
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:16777:149"/>
will, and of the cuſtome or vſe of them, two verie mutable things. Wherefore ſeparating theſe two, and taking words in them ſelues, you shall finde that man's will doth put di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſignifications vpon the ſame word, ether by chance, or onſett pourpoſe; by chance as you declared but now, which in deede doth not teach to manie words, but is caſuall as the cauſe of it is; on ſett pourpoſe, and that ether for want of words, or by deſire of elegance and varietie in our deliuerie, And this belongeth to allmoſt all the words wee haue, for there is ſcarſely anie word (if you note it) but may be ſo vſed, and if it may be ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it is ſo one time or other. This multiplicitie of variously
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:16777:150"/>
taking words in Logicke is ſaid, by who maketh the leaſt, to be eight fold, for ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke no end of multiplying the ſortes of it, And vnder the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Equiuocation or Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie it much confoundeth all ſcholaſticall learning. Now for the cuſtome and vſe of words there be manie things to be reſpected, as the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of times, and qualities of perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for in one time a word may ſignifie one thing, and in an other a quite differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thing, So wee ſee that thoſe who wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of eloquence giue words their births <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16777:150"/>
words in remoter parts and villages. Nay if you marke it you shall finde that as langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in generall are the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a multitude of men, ſo almoſt euerie particular man is Maſter, and as it were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſome particular expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or phraſes not common to others, whereby ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them ſelues more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainely, others more confuſedly and ambiguouſly, in ſo much that Critickes, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in antient Writings, Will attribute or derogate certaine workes from Authors vpon this only ground.

                  <p>Your anſwere is partly true, but not ſufficient, for you were to conſidere whether ſo manie bookes of one language may haue beene conſerued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if the Countrie be litle, few bookes will be wr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itten in the language, but if the language be diſperſed
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16777:151"/>
through manie Countries, it will haue it's proper words and ſignifications for euerie Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untrie. So that bookes being written for the ſubiects, and not for the language, (as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionaries and phraſe bookes are) it muſt needes follow that only ſo much of the language will be conſerued as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the vnderſtanding of thoſe bookes, which of them ſelues are ſo good, as that the people will ſtill deſire to haue them and continue them. Wherefore nether all bookes that are written, nor, (if we iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge by theſe of our time anie notable part wil be conſerued, nor yet the whole language contained in all the bookes that are written. And if part of the language be loſt, part

                  <p>It is true thoſe things are made to take awaie equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, but if you reflect you shall finde that the want of them, and the confuſed or
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:16777:152"/>
vnexact vſe of them, doth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe cauſe it, and where they are more aboundant (as in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me languages) there the abuſe of them is more frequent people being in nothing more vnwarie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their words; And where they are but rare and few, that likewiſe of it ſelf cauſeth ambiguitie. And if you will looke into tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe particular languages whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein the ſcripture was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiuely written, you shall finde that the Hebrew hath eight moodes wholy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from anie of ether the Greeke or Latin moodes, and euer varying the ſenſe, as much as the actiue and paſſiue doe in Latin and Greeke. The Greekes haue ſeuen tenſes all of different ſignifications, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:16777:153"/>
of numbers, genders, perſons three a peece. The Latin ſix caſes. So that you ſee new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Equiuocation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in euerie word, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently what obſcuritie and doubtfullneſſe muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie follow anie language or ſenſe relying vpon words; and yet for breuitie ſake, I haue not tould you the half of what the matter giueth me ſcope to ſaie. for the ſcripture depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and hath beene original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written in more languages then I haue ſpoken of, Where of ſome haue much more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie then anie of thoſe that I haue expreſſed. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction you may firſt conceiue that the verie pointing and accenting of words doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a number of doubts and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:16777:153"/>
Equiuocations, a diuers <hi>comma</hi> or <hi>virgula</hi> making ſome times the ſenſe quite different. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that word which is conſtrued with an other to cleere the ſignification of it, is ſome times it ſelfe of no leſſe ambiguitie then the other. Thirdly in the ſame conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it may happen that the ſame two words will haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſenſes. And of all theſe your Grammer and Oratory Maſters, doe enlarge their precepts. And aboue all there is an Equiuocation in the moſt commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> words wee vſe, riſing out of a kinde of cuſtome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of particular times and places, which the compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Ciuill law thought to be of ſo great importance as that they iudged it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

               <p>FIrſt therefore the Hebrew hath two proprieties verie conſiderable, the one, that it is thought to be the shorteſt language in the world, the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:16777:157"/>
other, that it is the moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. For the firſt, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth cheefely in the writing of the words, and in the ſcarcitie of bookes. For the writing, all the vowells are ſuppoſed, not expreſſed in the originall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and therefore only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by memorie, and to memory we muſt truſt for them. I confeſſe they are now expreſſed by pointes, wherein there is great miſtaking, the rules thereof being verie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and the more in that theſe rules and the practize of them were varied according to the diuerſitie of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries wherein the Iewes haue beene diſperſed. The reaſon of their writing without points I conceiue was, becaus their vowells being at the firſt
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:16777:158"/>
but fiue, by making long and short grew to be more; and ſo the firſt figures of them to ſtand only for the conſonant vſe of ſome vowells, or els to haue no ſound. But what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the origine was, the effect muſt of neceſſitie breede a great obſcuritie and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe in the language, the vowells though fewer yet in vſe being verie neere as much as the conſonants. The words are all of one or two ſillables if anie be of more, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted exoticke, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore verie like one an other, which is alſo increaſed by the neereneſſe of diuers of their letters. So that both their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation and writing being eaſily miſtaken and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bring's a great diſorder in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:16777:158"/>
the language. This is likewiſe augmented by the want they haue of coniunctions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which not being of a ſufficient number make the conſtruction verie equiuocall manie times. For the ſcaretie of bookes, you may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, if you doe but know that the legitimate Hebrew is wholy contained in the old ſcripture, whereof ſome parts were not written in Hebrew, and if you ſaw the booke in a ſmale print, and yet the letter bigger then our litle latin cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, you would ſee it is but a verie litle booke. And what ſoeuer beſides is written in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is not warrantable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the text, The Rabins affecting manie diuerſities as well in words and ſtile, as in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:16777:159"/>
writing. Nay perhaps I might add to this, that the characters them ſelues haue beene wholy changed ſince the beginning, and that it is credibly reported to haue beene once loſt and reſtored only by the memorie of Eſdras. So that we haue the leaſt aſſurance of this langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge that almoſt can be of anie not entirely extinguished For the proprietie of the Hebrew's Eloquence it conſiſteth che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efely in figures, tranſlations, and number. Figures or ſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are the higheſt part of proper Rhetoricke, becauſe they contayne the greateſt force and ſwaye that words can giue to our appetit, and if they bee rightly applyed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie a way the auditor euen againſt his will vnto a ſtrong
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16777:159"/>
and ſadaine action. Theſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Prophets vſe them more perfectly then euer anie Poet or Orator did, yet doe they not cauſe much obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vnleſſe it be when they are vſed in Dialogue forme, which where it is vſed in ſcripture, t'is hard to diſcerne, How ſoeuer they are a conuincing proofe that who vſeth them much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de's not his writings should be dogmaticall and deciſiue. Tranſlations or metaphores are cauſe of great obſcuritie, and therefore we ſee the Poets who cheefely vſe them; are not to be redd (vntill a man be exerciſed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) without ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and paines. Nor doe anie Greeke or Latin examples shew that ſtrength which the ſcripture hath in this kinde.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:16777:160"/>
The number or Cadence; which one would thinke could not be ſuſpected of anie ſuch matter, is a cauſe of great am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie, for the Hebrews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholy giuen there vnto in their ſcripture, haue ſo manie accents of diuers effects, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof one manie times ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth for an other, or is like an other in figure, that you had neede of an Ariadne to lead you thorough. Some of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents are Grammaticall, ſome Rhetoricall, ſome muſicall, and as much a doe with them as with the reſte of the words, and verie hard it is to know when it is one accent, when it is an other, and when it hath this effect, when that. Who therefore would haue recour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to the Hebrew Text for

By our Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>klefiſts how all things be not gouerned by a fatall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, And all theſe renewed by the libertie and confuſion of our laſt ages.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:16777:168"/>
how the truths of theſe diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are like the paſſage betwixt Scylla and Charybdis, limited betwixt two errours ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly as that when they are ſpoken of at large and not dogmatically, (ſpecially befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they be examined and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpeaker by miſtruſt of oppoſition is made warie) it is almoſt impoſſible the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker should be ſo iuſt and ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ight in his language, as not to giue occaſion to one who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes after him, to pretende his fauour for the one or the other errour.

logicall and abſtracted notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and force the Catholikes to follow them, if they will not deſert their antient truths, ſo that after a while one knoweth not where the controuerſie ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, now, I ſaie, is it poſſible that anie rationall man should thinke that theſe and the like queſtions can be diffinitiuely reſolued by a criticall libratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of dead and vncertaine words full of equiuocall ambiguitie, their ſenſe and meaning lying in the breſt and minde of him who is not to be found, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſed manie ages agone? And if they cannot (as it is more then euident they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) shall wee thinke that Chriſt Ieſus hath left and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished no meanes or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie vpon earth to take vp theſe quarells and decide the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe controuerſies? shall matters

                  <p>Why then, cozen, you may thinke that you did not perfectly ſee the collour of the walle before, for the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the walle muſt needes be the collour of the parts, and you ſaie the collour of the parts is not one but manie, and therefore you only ſaw the

collour of thoſe parts which did exceede the reſt. And if you tooke anie of thoſe litle parts and put it in a multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſſe, you would ſee as great difference of parts, and peraduenture of collours to, in it, as you ſaw in the walle when you were within a ſpanne of it; ſo that if one should aske you what you haue ſeene you would hardly quit your ſelf handſomly of the queſtion.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:16777:173"/>
as we take a diſcourſe or playe which pleaſingly paſſeth away without anie great demurr, or particular weighing of euerie word; The other more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and exact looknig into euerie litle proprietie which may breede anie diuerſitie. And I ſuppoſe you would tell me that this ſecond belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth only to ſchollers, but that the former guideth our life and gouerneth our actions. And t'is true I ſee the people is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily caried a waye by their preachers, Antient common wealths by their Oratours, and in what matter ſoeuer an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and elaborate diſcours which paſſeth ſweetly in this ſort gaine's preſently the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of the Auditorie. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore I muſt needes confeſſe

that what good effect ſoeuer is the end for which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ordained, if it be anie thing belonging to man's life and conuerſation, it muſt be compaſſed by this groſſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ordinarie courſe of reading and vnderſtanding it. Where as if a man should ouer examine euerie word he would not finde grounde to fixe him ſelf with aduantage and vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Is not this your meaning?</p>

                  <p>You are verie right. And ſurely if we looke into what is in the ſcripture neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for our good life and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conuerſation, we shall finde plainely that t'is to be had this waie. As the direction of our liues and actions to God, acknowledging all things from him, Comfort in

aduerſitie, moderation in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, compaſſion of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, helping of the needie, Rewards of vertue, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vice, examples of both, and in a word the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the loue of God and our neighbour, and of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:16777:175"/>
ſcripture is able to doe, for we ſee thoſe who write of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies doe alledge but few places, nor thoſe vnauoidable nether, for ſome pointes of Catholike doctrine. Nor is it to be expected, Becauſe man's nature being euer to add to what is alreadie learned, And ſeeing likewiſe that long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe maketh men perfect in all arts, There being no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to perfect in ſome ſort the inſtruction of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the oeconomie of the church, and ſome ſuch other things, which the oppreſſed Primitiue church could not bring to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le I ſaie if theſe and the like things can not in particular be shewd in the ſcripture; but shall therefore I know not
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:16777:176"/>
who riſe vp and exclame theſe things be ſuperſtitious, hurtfull to the faithfull a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d make a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to deſtroy them? Who doth not ſee that this were plaine faction and Rebellion? The other meanes or waye to make one a Catholike is by ſome common principle; as if by reading of ſcripture wee finde nothing contrarie to the Catholike tenet or practize which our Aduerſarie call's in queſtion: or alſo if wee finde it comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded there in generall, or the authours and obſeruers of it praiſed and extolled. And in this waye I doubt not but a ſenſible and diſcreete reading of ſcripture at large, may and will make anie true ſtudent of it, a perfect beleeuing Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, ſo he proceede with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie,

As theſe are do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth in our caſe, both in the eye and in the vnderſtanding.

Wherefore you shall haue them cite manie places, ſome proper, ſome Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, ſome common, all, ſome times, auoidable if they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſeperatly, but the whole diſcours more or leſſe forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble according to the naturall parts or heauenly light more or leſſe communicated to one then to an other, yet ſtill in the proportion of oratours who ſpeake to the multitude and not to Socrates or Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus. Wherefore the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in this kinde was a fitting weapon for them, and the churche's continuing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remaining in their doctrine sheweth that they vſed it dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly, and as it ougth to be vſed with relation and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tradition.</p>

                  <p>I am farr fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſliking diſputation out of ſcripture, ſo it be donne with thoſe conditions which are fitting, and which may bring the matter to ſome vpsh ott. The firſt rule I would haue a Catholike obſerue is, not to diſpute with a Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:16777:179"/>
vnleſſe he promiſe to proue his poſition euidently and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly. For ſince the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like knowes there may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wittie probabilities and hard places of ſcripture brought againſt him, it were madneſſe in him to leaue his tenet, cuſtome <hi>[optima legum interpres)</hi> ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for him, and the practize of the church being on his ſide, which is the greateſt argument that can be brought to shew how and in what se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe the ſcriptures, which that church hir ſelf deliuereth, are to be vnderſtood, it were, I ſaie, meere follie in a Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to leaue his <hi>tenent</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of an other only for a probable and likely interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, his owne being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by that practize which
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:16777:180"/>
maketh it more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And it is cleere, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant muſt needes pleade aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt poſſeſſion, for at the firſt breaking when the Proteſtants pretended to reforme the church, she was ſurely in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of thoſe things which they pretended to take awaie, and in poſſeſſion of that ſenſe of the ſcripture which they prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be falſe and wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. And ſurely no man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe who is in poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hath the law in his owne hands, will yeild it vp without euidence on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie part. The ſecond rule I deſire a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike should obſerue is, not to thinke his cauſe loſt becauſe him ſelf cannot anſwere the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts propoſed againſt him, nor to venter his cauſe and his
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:16777:180"/>
poſſeſſion vpon his owne wit. For the diſputation being in a matter wherein, according to the Proteſtants groundes, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no certaintie, it followeth that who hath the better wit, or is more practized in this matter, may bring an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a good ſcholler cannot ſolue at the firſt ſight, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ether he or ſome other may. And what a follie were it for a man to venture his ſoule and conſcience vpon a ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie or preſent flash of wit, whereof peraduenture within an hower hee him ſelfe will ſee the falſitie, and condemne his owne errour. Wherefore a Catholike is not to venter the cauſe vpon his owne head, nor to confeſſe it weake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot defende it, for
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:16777:181"/>
both may he improue him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and ſome others perhapps may goe farr beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him. The third rule is, that the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke should neuer vndertake to conuince his Aduerſarie out of ſcripture, but content him ſelf that theſe words may well beare this ſenſe, which is in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Catholike church, And this is both more eaſie to performe and ſufficient for his pourpoſe. For the Catholike hath an aſſured grounde of his faith beſides ſcripture, and which relyeth not vpon it, nay he holdeth that his Religion cannot be wholy conuinced out of ſcripture, to what end therefore, (vnleſſe he would show his wit) should he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to proue his <hi>tenents,</hi> by ſcripture? For this were to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:16777:181"/>
ſtrenghen his opponent in his owne grounde and principle, to wit, that all is to be proued out of ſcripture.</p>

                  <p>You would binde Proteſtants to verie vnequall conditions, if you will oblige them to conuince, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike not, nay that it shalbe ſufficient for the Catholike to shew this may be the meaning of this or that place of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereas the Proteſtant shalbe forced to proue cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and euidently that this is the verie ſenſe of the text.</p>

                  <p>Not I, cozen, but the Proteſtants them ſelues oblige the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to this hard meaſure, for if a man should ſtrongly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine that a Beetle were the beſt inſtrument, to cut withall, and you ſaie no,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:16777:182"/>
were no he bound to cut with a Beetle, and it were no ſenſe, to ſaie, that you should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to doe it, ſince you man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it to be impoſſible. So they who hold that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the true iudge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, and fit and able to decide all quarells and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions about the Chriſtian faith and law, binde them ſelues, by holding this, to conuince their poſitions by ſcripture, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be exacted at his hands, Who ſaith ſcripture was not made for this end, nor is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for it. And looke vpon Luther and the Heretikes of his time<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nay vpon the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of our days, and ſee if they doe not all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, that they can conuince their <hi>tene<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> by ſcripture, and ſaie that our
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:16777:182"/>
forefathers were wholy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſcripture, and that wee now liuing knowe nothing of it. But to goe on with our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of diſputing out of ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. The fourth condition shall bee that the Catholike doe not admitte anie negatiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ofes, as to ſaie, this is an errour becauſe you can shew no ſcripture for it. For this is no proofe vnleſſe they will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that nothing is true but ſcripture, or that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to bee donne but what is ordained by ſcripture, which were abſurd, for nether Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, nor, I thinke, anie good Proteſtant will admitte of that ſuppoſition, being it were not only to take away the power of the church, but euen nature from nature, for nature
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:16777:183"/>
teacheth vs to helpe our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues where ſcripture doth not contradict, and as a Puritant ſeeketh a pulpit or high place to preach in, without looking whether he haue a warrant for it in the ſcripture to command him, ſo rationall and ſenſible men doe ſeeke a particular habit for a preacher or Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie man whereby he may be more decent and comely, and his words and exhortations be receiued with more reſpect and authoritie, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, where it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, it maketh the thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to be neceſſarie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re it is ſilent, there it maketh nothing vnlawfull.</p>

they would keepe of I warrant you. Yet this I muſt tell you, that it were a great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for indifferent men, that haue beene brought vp in this verball and apparent reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the ſcripture, to ſee that the poſitions you would induce them vnto, can bee and are maintened by ſcripture, and that they are grounded therein.

                  <p>For their ſakes, cozen, I will tell you of an other ſort of diſputation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein the Proteſtant shall haue no other diſaduantage but of his cauſe. For I thinke that the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:16777:184"/>
Catholike cauſe may not only be maintened by ſcripture, but alſo that it hath the better ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding preciſely to ſcripture alone. I confeſſe this kinde of diſputation is not fit for manie Auditors, but only for mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and vnderſtanding men. And it is to make this, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. <hi>Whether partie is more probable if only ſcripture were to bee alleadged.</hi> This Queſtion requireth diuers ſuppoſitions where vpon both ſides are to be agreed, which I feare will bee ſome what hard. As what texts are to preuaille, what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries or explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shall be allowed of, what is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and an improper ſpeeche, amongſt improper ſpeeches which muſt be preferred, what copies of euerie text
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:16777:184"/>
shalbe held for good, what coniectures shall be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted null againſt the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe, And manie other ſuch poſitions which would not be eaſily reſolued. This donne let both ſides bring their places for the pointe in queſtion, and ſo the diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will only be of the qualificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the places, that is, to shew whether are more appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and likely of the two. And for this I ſee lekewiſe that ſo manie lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall principles are firſt to bee reſolued, which partly are fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und as yet amongſt the critic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes diſputations, as that all the Logickes hitherto inuented would not afford ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t light and inſtruction, to make an euident concluſion, whether ſide were more apparent in
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:16777:185"/>
words and Tetxs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may gheſſe how farr theſe diſputations out of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> clearing doubts, what litle good cometh of them, vnleſſe they bee well gouerned, And how for the moſt part the beſt credit or the beſt tongue carrieth awaie the day by the Auditor's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicat opinion or weakneſſe. In a word the ſcripture being not written for this end, to wit, for the deciſion of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, it is not to bee expected that it should bee, of it ſelfe, without the churche's authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie much profitable for that pourpoſe, but to informe our liues by an ordinarie reading of it, or by preaching, ſinging, and ſuch like vſes, things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in the verie letter
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:16777:185"/>

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:16777:186"/>
neceſſitie be true, if ſcripture bee our rule. But this they can neuer proue, And therefore they ſeeke firſt to withdraw, vs from a ſecure and naturall meanes of relying vpon our forefathers, (Which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in all ciuill and oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conuerſation they them ſelues can not liue without) and then to leaue vs to a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of voluntary and vnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable diſputations. Reflect then I pray, cozen, vpon what wee haue ſaid, and compare our yeſternight's and this our morning's diſcourſe together, conſidering firſt how manie things are of neceſſitie to bee conſerued in the church for the preſeruation of faith and good life in hir ſubiects; Then ſee how manie pointes haue
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:16777:186"/>
beene and are quarelled, and if anie haue eſcaped, how all the reſt may be caled in queſtion with as much probabilitie and apparence as theſe are, Then looke vpon the qualities of that <hi>Decider of controuerſies</hi> where vnto all the Aduerſaries of the Catholike church doe ſeeke to draw vs, by which the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re can be no other end of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies but to leaue euerie man to his owne will. And then conclude that theſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being put, there will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remaine gouerment in the church, nor certaintie or conſtancie in beliefe, nor anie thing to be taught and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed worthie God Allmightie's ſending of a lawgiuer, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of ſending his owne ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vpon thoſe hard conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

                  <p>I doubt not but anie Proteſtant of them all would anſwere you, that at leaſt in the Apoſtles time Chriſt had a viſible church, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting of the faithfull which adhered to the Apoſtles and ſuch Bishopps as were made by them; but that ſince that

                  <p>You are likewiſe perſuaded, I ſuppoſe, cozen, by the ſame euidence, that in the Apoſtles time <hi>this church</hi> was a communion with the particular church of Rome and therefore I will goe a litle further and aske you, whether you doe not thinke, that this church, Whereof the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church of Rome was a part (and peraduenture the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall) Was not to bee obeyed by euerie particular man and euerie particular church, she

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or parts?

                  <p>All this is ſo euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that I thinke nether Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant nor Puritant will deny it. But what doe you drawe out of this?</p>

                  <p>Nay ſoftly, cozen, I muſt aske you one queſtion more before I conclude anie thing, and it is. What became of this church when it fell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt? I meane, were the men
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:16777:191"/>
and their gouernors ſodainly extinct, and others raiſed in their places, or did there ſtill continue a publicke face and ſucceſſiue gouerment of the ſame church euen in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and ſo the externall church remained and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our days, though with corrupt faith and doctrine?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Nephew.</speaker>
                  <p>This I doubt not likewiſe but euerie one will grant you, for all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants that euer I heard doe acknowledge it, nor doe I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that anie will deny it.</p>

                  <speaker>Vncle.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then, cozen, wee will draw this concluſion, that, <hi>That church</hi> which is now in communion with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular church of Rome, was once the true church, or if you pleaſe to ſaie, she was but a
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:16777:192"/>
part of the true church, ſo let it bee at leaſt she had the true faith and doctrine, and euerie particular man or church with in hir owne compaſſe was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to obey hir, as hauing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe worthie titles which you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge euen now to bee then due vnto hir. But now if a Proteſtant telleth you, shee hath ſince fallen and loſt thoſe goodly titles, How would you conuince him? or at leaſt can you tell me.</p>

For all the pointes wherein we differ from Proteſtants are of that nature, that they incite vs to the practize of ſome vertue or other.

I knowe the readie anſwere is, that all is but hypocriſie, and that there is as great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe amongſt Catholikes as amongſt Proteſtants. But I could wish that hee who is thus rash a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d readie to ſaie this, were as curious and carefull to know how to proue it. For it were abſurde to thinke that who ſtrike's but one blowe in twentie in a ſmith's shoppe should make as great a dinte as hee who ſtrike's twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie.

For ſacriledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo great where ſainctitie is leſſe, and who beſt knowe's his Maſters will muſt needes deſerue moſt ſtripes for his treſpaſſe.

Wherefore Proteſtants cannot be ſo wicked as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, hauing not ſuch a ſaintly faith nor ſuch a ſacred church to diſgrace and abuſe.

As for the vices, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof I heare the reports, and doubt not but they are to true, yet I ſee they are caried diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly and breake not forth into anie publicke ſcandall. So that although Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts haue diuers morall honeſt men and Catholikes manie wicked, yet doth it not follow that they are equall in behauiour.

Farther if we Catholikes hold the truth of ſcripture as conſcientiouſly as anie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, and therefore that all controuerſies betwixt vs and them are only concerning the ſenſe of it, and not touching the truth of it, t'is manifeſt that Catholikes muſt ether be ſuch dull dunces as not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their arguments, or ſo willfull as not to acknowledge what they ſee a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d know, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſurely they would agree with Proteſtants in all pointes which they could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince and demonſtrate.

vertue may haue a bridle for a while, yet would not learni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g be learning if it should not for the moſt part worke it's effect in men, and make them more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reaſon then others: And much leſſe can it be true vertue which is ſeldome effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, ſithence vertue's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be <hi>operatiue.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this vnderſtanding man that ſee's there's a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant pourſuite of vertue and learning on the one ſide then on the other, conclude's eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie weakneſſe on the learneder and more vertuous ſide in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of the other.

                  <p>Is it not like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles beſtowed neere about as much time? S.

And we may well thinke the like of the reſt of the Apoſtles,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:16777:221"/>
whereſoeuer they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently doe it, but ſpecially in the churches in which they made their Reſidence. But why thinke you tooke they ſo much time for ſo short a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as you ſee Chriſtian doctrine is, being included in our Creede.</p>

                  <p>No doubt but their imployment was to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke their diſciples and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnderſtand perfectly, and fully comprehende all poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Chriſtian doctrine, to reſolue all doubts and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, to make the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the doctrine ſincke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the verie ſoules of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to ſetle a forme of Gouerment and Conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to invre the firſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the practize of this doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

                  <p>I doe imagine that meeting together they

would examine this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>taking ſor their rule</hi> that doctrine which the Apoſtle deliuered vnto them, And knowing that he could nether contradict him ſelf nor anie of his Breetheren, being all inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Holy Ghoſt, they would conclude, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouators reaſons were capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, his texts wrong vnderſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od if they were obſcure, or corrupted if they were plaine. For nothing could be ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vnto them as that, which for three yeares together had beene perpetually beaten into them, where in they had bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne continually examined and cleered, and which had beene ſo long the fundation of their new manner of life and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze; ſo that, this muſt needes be
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:16777:223"/>
the moſt euident vnto them of all things, and therefore they would ſurely forgoe all other rules to gouerne them ſelues by this, as being moſt frie from errour,</p>

                  <speaker>Vncle.</speaker>
                  <p>Your concluſion follow's plainely. For they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other ſtay of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, then that S.

Paul had taught them?</hi> And therefore to be againſt that which they had beene taught, to them, was to be falſe. So that there nether was nor could be anie other queſtion in the church at that time in matters of faith, but
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:16777:224"/>
                     <hi>whether the Apoſtles had taught ſuch a doctrine or no?</hi> For the Apoſtles hauing ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo much time in teaching Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in ſo litle a Prouince, what they had not taught muſt needes be preſumed not to be neceſſarie, and conſequently not deſeruing to make a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and breach amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and what they had taught to be without all controuerſie true and certaine. Wherefore if ſuch an Innouator would not ſtand to this iudgment, he was to be expelled the church, as diſagreeing from the Chriſtians in the <hi>principall rule</hi> and <hi>ſoueragne Tribunal of Chriſtianitie</hi> by <hi>which,</hi> and <hi>only which,</hi> they could at that time decerne and decide what was Chriſtian doctrine what not.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:16777:224"/>
Happie that age in which it was ſo eaſie to reſolue anie dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie ariſning, for it was no more then to meete together and aske one an other, <hi>How haue you beene taught?</hi> And all was ended, and who should haue reſiſted this deciſion was to be caſt out with common conſent as a reprobate.

                  <p>It is not needfull, for ſithence the laſt age doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly know what was the Apoſtles doctrine, All ſuch ages as can reach to knowe the doctrine and practize of that laſt age, are able certainely to reſolue (though in a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) anie ariſing difficultie; not becauſe they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely tell, that ſuch a pointe is contrarie to the doctrine of the Apoſtles, but becauſe they can tell that t'is againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the fiſt deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which doctrine they know to be the dokrine of the Apoſtles.

enough to show that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of his time was the ſame which we now profeſſe And we that haue our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion from him (according to venerable Bede) wee, I ſaie, who are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from the Saxons, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue had anie Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but <hi>that</hi> which the Proteſtants call Poperie, And therefore to vs English men, it is moſt cleere, that we neuer had anie Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſince Gregorie the great's time, but Poperie.

                  <p>I am affraid theſe calculations may ouer reach me, for I fee the father and the ſonne's age doe concurre in ſome part, and therefore by counting them ſeuerally the number of yeares will be greater then in deede ought to be allowed.</p>

                  <p>You ſaie well, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16777:228"/>
therefore we will only take that number of yeares which the father ordinarily liueth before the birth of his ſonne, As if the ſonne be ſuppoſed to be 20. yeares of age when the father teſtifieth, and the father 60. Which you ſee is verie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſo the number of yeares of one deſcent will be 40. Which is the number we put. But if the father be 80. when the ſonne is 20. then the number of one deſcent wilbe 60. Which though it be ſome what great, becauſe it is rare that a man hath a child at 60. yet t'is not ſo rare but a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand may bee found in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent extent, as in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of England, and this number is amply ſufficient for the effect we deſire, for fiue
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:16777:228"/>
deſcents of 60. yeares make 300. yeares. And hauing tould you how a generall practize of anie countrie is knowne by a kind of <hi>ſelf ſeeing</hi> for fiue deſcents, which include's at leaſt 200. yeares, it will follow that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt time to ours by two ages at a time, we may frame our diſcourſe thus. As thoſe who liued in the beginning of the third age could certainely know they held the Apoſtles doctrine; ſo thoſe who liued in the beginning of the fift age, could certainely know they held the doctrine of thoſe of the beginning of the third age, that is, the doctrine of the Apoſtles. And by the like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thoſe of the 7. age will be certaine they are in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:16777:229"/>
faith of thoſe of the fift, and thoſe of the 9. in the faith of thoſe of the 7. And ſo to our verie ſelues, And all are certaine that they are in the faith of the Apoſtles. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this conſequence is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe two ages is not ſo great a ſpace, but that certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of publicke and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges through a kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me (much more through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie) may be eaſily had; nor yet are two ages ſo litle, as that a great errour could lurke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene and lye ſmoothered for ſo long a time. We therefore who now liue in communion with the Roman church know certainely, that our forefathers of the 16. and 15 ages did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that this faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which we hold, did, I
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:16777:229"/>
ſaie, conceiue and thinke it to haue deſcended vnto them from the Apoſtles, And we know likewiſe that they could not conceiue and thinke ſo, but that they knew the 14. and 13. ages did belieue the ſame; Nor thoſe of the 14. and 13. ages could not haue the ſame beliefe, vnleſſe they had ſeene and receiued it, <hi>in</hi> and <hi>from</hi> the 12. and the 11. age. And put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all theſe together, (the certaintie whereof is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly founded in this our age) you ſee they comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ſix ages, if we put 40. yeares to a deſcent, and will comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de 8. or 9. ages if we put 60. to a deſcent. So that two or at muſt three ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s will reach beyond Chriſt's birth, And therefore we doe not,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:16777:230"/>
nor cannot, want euidence but eyes to ſee it.</p>

                  <p>There be two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why no pointe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine can be ſo ſmale as to creepe in without a great change. The one is becauſe Chriſtian doctrine is a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:16777:230"/>
whoſe parts are ſo knit together as that one thred ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken but it will rauell through manie ſtiches, As fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> th' Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereſie denying Chriſt to be God, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>no Trinitie,</hi> and ſo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians would eaſily become naturall philoſophers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, <hi>no Incarnation, that</hi> is, no God and man in one perſon, <hi>All the payeres and adorations which the church had vſed hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therto were to be changed, The forme of baptiſme were to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> And thus we might goe through the moſt part of Chriſtian doctrine, if we looke into the ſequels of Arrianiſme. And ſuch like conſequences may be deduced out of Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſme, and out of almoſt all othet hereſies, which haue not
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:16777:231"/>

The other reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no new doctrine can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in the church of God without impeaching <hi>tradition,</hi> the rule of faith, for that being once broken and reiected, by the ſame right and principle by which they profeſſe one errour, they may profeſſe anie, And you ſee the diſciples of Hereſiarckes neuer faile to grow worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Maſters, Luther broke the Ice by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to ſcripture, Suinglius went farther then he, th' Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts exceeded the Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians, the Adamiſtes, paſſed th' Anabaptiſts, the Socinians
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:16777:231"/>

                  <p>I ſee now, vncle, it was not without cauſe you aſked me, what time the Apoſtles imployed in teaching Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine to ſome one Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce or Countrie, your whole diſcourſe ſeeme's to depende vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, that the Apoſtles did not barely tell the faithfull what Chriſt had donne and taught, bud did inculcate and beat it into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both by words and actions, invring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the practize of their beliefe, their beliefe being the ground of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:16777:232"/>
their actions, and their actions the effects of their beliefe, and therefore could not be altered without a maine change both in their faith and practize, their beliefe mantaining their practize and their practize ſtrengthening their beliefe. And truly I ſee this is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall waie to keepe Religion vncorrupted, And that nature, and neceſſitie, droue the firſt Chriſtians vpon occaſion of anie controuerſie, to ſeeke what the Apoſtles had taught, which being once begunne the enſuing Chriſtians would follow the ſame courſe, as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as controuerſies could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued this waie, which by your diſcourſe may be done at this daie.

And t'is much more eaſie to conceiue how the church is and may be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how mankinde hath beene and wilbe conſerued, whereof I thinke no man doubts.

ſatisfaction but ſuch as man's nature ſcarſely afforde's. Yet to anſwere fully to you maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, firſt I will oppoſe an other vnto it, and by comparing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shall better vnderſtand the meaning of them both. And t'is that <hi>fruſtra eſt potentia quae nunquam reducitur ad actum,</hi> Wherevnto we may add that God, the Author of nature, neuer made anie thing in vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, ſo that when the ſame power or poſſibilitie is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for diuers effects or ends, then if anie of it's effects be brought to paſſe it hath ſo farr arleaſt got it's end as that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to haue beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in vaine, And therefore t'is no good argument to argue from the power or poſſibilitie to anie one of it's effects in
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:16777:234"/>
particular, becauſe it's e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d may be ſufficiently obſerued by an other effect. But if the power or poſſibilitie haue but one effect then your firſt maxime faile's, by reaſon of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for being the power hath but one effect, if <hi>that</hi> be not put, the power muſt needes be in vaine. Wherefore putting ſuch a poſſibilitie, leaſt it should be fruſtrate. you muſt needes put the effect, and conſequently the argument is ſtill good, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is a power or poſſibilitie therefore an effect. And this follow's moſt cleerely in our caſe, for if Almightie God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſet cauſes which may and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make his church eternall, that is, if he haue put a power or poſſibilitie of <hi>eternall duration</hi> in his chureh, This effect, to
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:16777:235"/>
wit, <hi>euerlasting continuance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a nature that it can be but one, t'is euident that ether this effect will follow, or elſe the poſſibilie is fruſtrate a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d put to no end, which in a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of ſuch a moment as that it is the verie ayme and end of all Gods workes, it were more then abſurde in common ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to grant ſuch a conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And to declare this more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly let vs conſidere that where there are manie varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that which cauſeth defect in one cauſeth abundance in an other. As if in diuers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries vnder ſeuerall climats,<note place="margin">Why Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So likewiſe the Catholike faith being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through manie ſeuerall countries, what in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie make's it faile, in an other will make it flourish. The hate betwixt France and ſpaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Luther's proceedings to be fauored in Germanie by the Princes which leaned to the french, and the ſame hatred made ſpaine and Italie to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them more vehemently. The power and authoritie of ſome one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one countrie may oppreſſe the church, whereas in an other, euen to diſcountenance that man, it shal be vpheld. And as in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ſo in time, diuers occaſions make it now fauored now miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:16777:236"/>
but t'is impoſſible, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth and conformable to reaſon, that there should be anie ſo generall and vniuerſall occaſion as to make it hated in all times and places, which would be neceſſarie for a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ruine. And this is it, which mantaine's all the progreſſe of nature, to wit, becauſe it hath rootes and principles in being, for no one ſorte of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing things, which haue being in manie farr differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Climats, can be exterminated, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the contraries which muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye it, are nether vniuerſall in place nor time, and therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re thoſe contraries being ſpent, the ſeedes of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them ſelues, ſprout out, and budd againe new bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches of the ſame kinde.

                  <p>Surely they cannot. For it were no generation of men, but beaſts, that were ſo
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:16777:242"/>
do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ltish and ſottish as to ſee ſo manie <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>harmes,</hi> which happen to all men wee know not whence, and thinke that there were no cauſe thereof, And therefore it is the moſt eaſie and moſt naturall concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te that man can haue, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that ſome thing is the cauſe of theſe goods and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Now man's conuerſation being cheefely with one an other, men naturally appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende all things to be donne by ſome <hi>vnderſtanding thing,</hi> as they ſee their owne actions are. So that if there were a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnie of men ſprung out of the earth, like Cadmus his people, or raiſed out of emitts, like the Myrmidons, yet would they (if they were truly men) within a litle while frame

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie they should conceite their <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>euills</hi> to proceede from ſome viſible or inuiſible thing Wherefore I admire not that ſome people adored the ſunne, ſome the ſtarrs, others ſome rare men from whom they had receiued in their life time great benefits, imagining that euen after death they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re power full and beneficiall. And ſurely it is much more impoſſible that a people which once hath had ſome Religion, should quitte for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, and come to haue none at all, for theſe cauſes will be euer knocking at their harts, putting them in minde, and driuing them into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceite

                  <p>Nay, ſir, I will doe you the fauour to exclude one of them, to wit, the waie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, or by alledging more reaſon againſt the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then can be brought for it, for ſeing truths beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to one another, and that the Religion we ſpeake of is ſuppoſed to be true; t'is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that more reaſon should be brought againſt it, then for it, Nor is the greatneſſe of anie man's wit, who should ſtand to maintaine the error, to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for this error being to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:16777:246"/>
through a great part of the world, t'is not credible that one man should ſo farr ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in wit the reſt of the world as to put them all from their ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding without contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Or that in ſo much time as is neceſſarie for the ſpreading of ſuch an error into the maine of the church, no man should haue wit enough, if not to bring more potent argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for the truth, atleaſt to finde out the weakeneſſe and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of thoſe which are brought againſt it, which would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to hinder the progreſſe of ſuch an error, for who is in poſſeſſion of an opinion muſt haue an inſoluable reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to put him out of it, if he be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and conſtant, Much more thoſe who ground their <hi>tenets</hi>

vpon receiuing them from their forefathers, and hould all reaſon inſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to proue their faith, becauſe of it's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturalitie, and therefore ought more to harken to what was deliuered, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to anie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which may ſeeme to vrge the change of what is knowne to be deliuered.

                  <p>You haue drawne the queſtion from an vniuerſall to a particular, for we ſpoke of a change betwixt two Religions
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:16777:247"/>
in common, and you ſpeake of a change from a true one to a falſe one. Yet this being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for our intent, I will add that if you had that conceite of the true Religion, which much thought hath bredd in me, to wit, that t'is the moſt high, wiſe, rationnall, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to man's nature, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, to all things fitting for man's life, that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, of all diſciplines and learnings poſſible, that it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into greater ſecrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwiſe wee should euer reach vnto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the knowledge which made antient and moderne ſages ſo proud, If you had, I ſaie, this conceite of the true Religion you would be much more confirmed and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:16777:247"/>
in this perſuaſion: But why doe you not thinke it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the authoritie of one man should ouerſwaye all the witts of the world? Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely the Diuill him ſelfe would rather helpe the church then permitte ſo litle pride amongſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Neuer yet anie great man wanted his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, who had he ſuch a flawe in is credit as this our ſubiect would giue him, it would quiekly hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his authoritie. Not anie of our neuer ſo much eſteemed fathers is receiued in all things; nor is anie of their authoritie's receiued in ſuch an eminent height, as is neceſſarie for the effect we ſpeake of. Who was greater then Origen? And yet was he
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:16777:248"/>
condemned euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was in greateſt vogue. But I neede not appeale to examples whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re nature by it's owne force ſtrike's the ſtroke. For ether this new doctrine is brought in openly by the ſtrong and earneſt endeauours of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor him ſelf (whoſe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie muſt ſwaye the world) and of his followers, And then by this verie negotiation it will diſcouer it's newneſſe; and being falſe the more it is ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the more it will shew it's weakneſſe, and at length goe out like a ſnuffe of it ſelf. Or els it come's in neglectedly, being written by the <hi>bye,</hi> and the Innouator's authoritie vrged by others vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and then the verie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner beare's with it ſo litle like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:16777:248"/>
and ſmale efficacitie as that it would be euerie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re chechked by reaſon of it's, newneſſe, and therefore could neuer paſſe vncontrowled through anie great extent. And if we put the caſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be in the Catholike church, where the truth is not to be handled by learned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as being aboue nature, but by what our forefathers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue taught vs, you ſee this great man's authoritie preſently vanisheth into ſmoake, being there's no place for anie man's authoritie, where the conſtant and vniuerſall verdict of the preſent world is againſt it, in reſpect whereof he is but a ſingle man. Concerning force or power you muſt ſuppoſe, before you can make anie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent

argument of it, 1. that this power is ouer the whole Chriſtian world, 2. to be ſo ſtrong that it feareth not to giue diſtaſte to the people, 3. to be vehemently deſirous to quell the ould faith and bring in a new one, 4. that it hath zealous miniſters for the ſame end, And laſtly that all theſe dure and continue vntill all the antient faith be extinct. And when all is done yet will it remaine vpon record and be knowne when this new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion began, and the violence being ended there's a roote in men's harts to reiect this new opinion and returne to the old ſuppoſing as we doe, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re's more reaſon for the old then for the new. So that in common ſenſe and nature's

principles the Pope had iuſt cauſe to write to the Emperor in theſe termes.</p>

when I deepely weigh what you ſaie againſt it, and balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the one with the other, I ſee my frame is limited within a ſmale compaſſe and few yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, but reacheth not to the vniuerſalitie and generall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or Gouerment of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

put the caſe that there were a Generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome ſitting for example in the yeare 1600. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much diſputation about fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a rule to ſetle matters of Religion, they should agree, that to receiue nothing but what had beene deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by hand to hand fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt and his Apoſtles, were the beſt waie to end all diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Religion, and there vpon decree, that hereafter nothing should be held for certaine and immutable, but what were ſo receiued; And that amongſt theſe Bishops one should riſe vp and make this difficultie, we cannot know that anie thing is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by hand to hand from Chriſt vnleſſe our forefathers
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:16777:255"/>
who liued in the laſt age 1500. haue deliuered it vnto vs as ſuch, which they cannot haue deliuered vnto vs but by one of theſe two waies, ether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we knowe they had this ſame principle, which we ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke here ro ſetle, (to wit, that they tooke nothing for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably certaine, and of faith but what was ſo deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them) And then we know what ſoeuer they haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs for a matter of faith, was like wiſe receiued by them, or atleaſt they thought it to be receiued in the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, and therefore we may be confident of it: Or elſe they muſt haue declared vnto vs what is ſo receiued, what not, that the one part may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by vs and eſtablished
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:16777:255"/>
as matters of faith, the other held in leſſe eſteeme and as no points of faith. This ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d we know hath not beene done, And therefore if our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had not this principle, how should we haue it? For if they had it not and haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered our doctrine and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs without diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we muſt of neceſſitie accept much for Religion, faith, and as receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, which we know not whether it was ſo or no; And therefore wee muſt ether willfully deceiue our ſelues and our ſucceſſors accounting and eſteeming things which were neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from Chriſt to haue beene receiued from him, and ſo falſly deliuer them for ſuch to our ſucceſſors, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:16777:256"/>
ground both our faith and theirs vpon this vntruth, that our <hi>tenets</hi> were receiued from Chriſt: Or elſe we muſt content our ſelues as our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers haue done, and ſetle no new ground of ending co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies in Religion. If one, I ſaie, should make this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in that graue Aſſemblie, would it not puzzell them all and put them of from their reſolution?</p>

                  <p>Truly, vncle, it could not chuſe, vnleſſe they were obſtinately reſolued to damne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues and all their poſteritie, and that impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſight of the whole world, which would reproach them with ſo notorious an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture.

And becauſe I fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſee your drift, I will gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you may frame the ſame argument for anie age, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no age in which this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could haue beene firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp, but only <hi>in ſuch an one,</hi> in which it was cleerely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne what the Apoſtles taught and what they did not by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who had their doctrine from their owne mouths, that is, the verie next age after the Apoſtles. So that we may euidently conclude that a church which now hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with vniuerſall conſent this principle, which you ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of, muſt of neceſſitie haue held the ſame from the next<pb n="496" facs="tcp:16777:257"/>

                  <p>Coſen, this queſtion trencheth vpon what we haue alreadie talked of, therefore I will only giue you ſuch a hint as your ſelf may worke vpon. Firſt it is as manifeſt an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie that a change of Religion should be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced inſenſibly into anie one Countrie, as that a burning feauer should for as long time conſume the ſame whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie without being taken noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of, or ſought to be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſithence as we ſaide natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re permit's vs not generally to be sleepie in Religion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to ſaie it shall paſſe imperceptible from country
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:16777:260"/>
to countrie and ſo get poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole Chriſtian world, is farr more impoſſible, men's natures and diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s being ſo diuers that if they were put to we are cappes or shoes a like it could not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected but by ſome publicke force or commande. Thirdly that this should be for ſo long a terme that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize should be quit forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue beene formerly in vſe and requeſt is yet beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d both. So that who ſoeuer is troubled with this doubt doth not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly vnderſtand the nature of Chriſtian Religion, which is a truth of the qualitie of ſcience hanging all together, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto a truth may be added and yet remaine whole, but if anie falſitie or croſſe poſition
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:16777:260"/>
be admitted, it will not only deſtroy the poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite, but alſo what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dependeth of it, that is, all in deede but cheefely tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſo we ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that none euer moued anie point of faith, but if their reuolt dured lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo farr, as to take a waie <hi>tradition</hi> the rule of all we are to belieue. But can you tell me, haue we reached to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of your demande a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d are you fully ſatisfied?</p>

                  <p>This you haue concluded that if our church rely vpon traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now, it euer did ſo; And if it euer did rely vpon tradition it muſt needes haue maintained the ſame doctrine from Chriſt's time to ours; for nether could

                  <p>Truly, cozen, your obiection is ſtrong, yet I hope
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:16777:263"/>
to content you. For the firſt part of it, I ſee no great matter in the varietie of opinions amongſt our Deuines, for you ſee they ſeeke out the <hi>Decider</hi> of pointes of doctrine, that is by whoſe mouth we are to know, (vpon occaſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute) what and which be our pointes and articles of faith, to wit, whether the Pope, or the Councell, or both. Which is not much materiall to our pourpoſe, what euer the truth be, ſuppoſing we acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge no articles of faith but ſuch as haue deſcended vnto vs by tradition from Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The ſecond part of your obiection ſeeme's to be of greater force, becauſe ſome Deuines ſeeme to acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge an authoritie in the church
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:16777:263"/>
which hath power, not only to determine ether ſpeculatiue or practicall points of doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne new, or ould, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as that the whole church is obliged to accepte or not oppoſe it's definition, (which euerie Catholike grante's, and the reaſons I tould you in our firſt conference doe euidently conuince) But alſo that this authoritie can ſo determine euen a ſpeculatiue pointe of doctrine, which hitherto was euer vncertaine nor euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as reueiled, or eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emed as an article of faith, that here after the vhole church shalbe obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, acknowledge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it as a reuealed and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie point of Chriſtian doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and as an article of faith.
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:16777:264"/>
Which opinion you muſt knowe, is but an opinion, nor doe the authours of it oblige anie man to belieue it as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, nor doe they condemne thoſe who nether doe, nor euer, will acknowledge anie ſuch poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore this ought not to trouble you.

ſee all agree vpon <hi>tradition,</hi> nor anie one ether denie it, or doubt of it, Whereas it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re's by the diuerſitie of their opinions that they doe not vniuerſally and generally agree in anie other meanes or rule of faith, though ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte of another in waie of opinion: Yet to giue you far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; I will teach you a point of philoſophie which perhapps you neuer fully vnderſtood.

                  <p>I put you only that
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:16777:272"/>
part of the queſtion, <hi>if the point were true,</hi> which you draw into the contrarie, <hi>if it were falſe,</hi> wherefore if it doe not follow that an vntruth can deceiue vs in that kinde, then there is no inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the former part, to wit, that truth may be taken as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not ſo deliuered. And the reaſon is cleare, for ſeeing the truths of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are knowne for the framing of our liues conformably vnto them, it importe's litle, in reſpect of vertue, vpon what grounds they are held in particular, ſo they be vniuerſally and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly held, for an action done in conſequence of ſuch belieued truths is neuer the worſe for the qualitie of the
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:16777:273"/>
certaintie of it's obiect. Yet for your farther ſatisfaction this I will adde, that how ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the common people doe not diſtinguish what is of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and what is but of ſome learned men's opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe thoſe whom we call Deuines (if truly they be ſuch as the name require's) may a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doe diſtinguish poſitions of ſuch different natures. For Chriſtian doctrine is not a bundle of looſe poſitions (as thoſe who negligently looke on it may thinke) but a true diſcipline hanging together by conſequences and order tending to one end. And of this doctrine and diſcipline ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me parts be ſuch as cannot be knowne but by immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, others ſuch as no
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:16777:273"/>
ſenſible man can doubt of, if he beleeue the former. And learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know that of both theſe two, the one is expreſly deliuered by tradition, the other is as firme as if it were ſo deliuered. For as it was reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that our ſauiour is truly God and man, ſo euerie man of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſenſe knowes that he had two <hi>wills, Deuine</hi> and <hi>human,</hi> againſt the Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. Other points there may be which neede art and ſtudie to deduce and fetch them out of the two former. And of theſe likewiſe a true Deuine cannot be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, being they are be fruits of learning and ſtudie, and conſequently haue euer beene in the ſoules and writings of learned Maſters. And theſe points euerie one
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:16777:274"/>
knowes who is conuerſant in Logike, and in iudging the qualities of ſuch propoſitions as belong to ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, And your ſelf I am ſure by the litle skill you haue therein, and by the ſmale light of this diſcourſe, will eaſtly iudge that this is reaſonable.</p>

take my words ſo preciſely, not in ſo rigorous a degree of compariſon, for ſo euen of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations the precedent will be eſteemed more certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne then that which is deduced out of it, though in a morall e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ANd this I will shew you in a word, becauſe it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into the repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of what we haue alreadie diſcourſed on. The impoſſibilities are three. Firſt it trencheth vpon the reſolution wee formerly made that one man's authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie could not preuaile againſt, and ouer the whole church; for this is the difference bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt a truth and a falſe hood, that a truth though it beginne from one yet may it be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by all, by reaſon of it's euidence, Which when one hath laid ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, others may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, not for the man's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but for the loue of the
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:16777:275"/>
ſeene truth: Whereas falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which cannot bring eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with it, muſt be bolſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by the man's credit a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reputation, which you know is inſufficient. Secondly it is impoſſible an errour should generally preuaille by reaſon of the immutabilitie which is in the vniuerſalitie of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent cauſes, whoſe particulars may be defectiue, but the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſalls cannot. So that as it is impoſſible in nature that all children should be borne with one eye, all coltes with three leggs, or the like, ſo were it a monſtrous accident, and that in a higher and more immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature, if an errour should generally preuaile and paſſe through all mankinde, or through ſo great a part of it as
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:16777:276"/>
we make accounte the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church is, and will euer be. The third impoſſibilitie is, becauſe it trencheth vpon the ſtabilitie of Religion, for ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence we agreed that t'is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for anie nation to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue no Religion, and as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to change a true into a falſe, And likewiſe that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine hath the nature of ſcience, ſo farre as that no errour can fall into it but muſt bring contradiction and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt the principles and receiued practize of the church, and ſo make a breach againſt the antient poſſeſſion, it doth therefore plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that as it is impoſſible for ſuch a breach to become vniuerſall in time and place, ſo likewiſe muſt it needes be
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:16777:276"/>
impoſſible that an vntruth should be vniuerſally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for <hi>tradition,</hi> hauing not beene deliuered as ſuch.</p>

For although a falſehood may be tould naturally, if <hi>that</hi> which is falſe be in our minde, ether by ſetled opinion or by the ſurpriſe of inconſideration, yet a <hi>lye,</hi> which is the putting by of that which is naturally in our minde, or at leaſt the hindering of it to manifeſt it ſelf and the ſubornation of an other thing to goe out in its place, cannot chooſe but be voluntary, and done for ſome end or reſpect which we ayme at. And the like may be ſaid to proue all vices to be againſt nature.<note place="margin">HoW all vice is aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> For if nature be the principle of action in vs, and none who beareth the face of man from the boy that play's at push pinne, to the Bishop
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:16777:281"/>

And ſo wee ſee that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is generally ashamed of vice, and what he is not a shamed of, he will not repute to be vice, but will defend it as reaſonable.</p>

                  <p>Giue me leaue to interrupt you ſir, For I feare I did not well declare my ſelf. It was not my minde to ſaie that reaſon is not the nature of man, But that there
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:16777:281"/>
is a maine difference betwixt the nature of man, which we call reaſon, compared to his morall actions; and betwixt the nature of other things (as of the elements) compared to their actions. And therefore although philoſophers may shew perhapps impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in nature, yet will it be hard to de the like in the actions of <hi>reaſon,</hi> or rather of the <hi>will,</hi> whoſe waies ſeeme to be vncertaine.</p>

                  <p>No, coſen, I did not miſtake your intention, but I make no difference betwixt the nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of other things but in excellencie, and I conceiue this excellencie of man's nature to conſiſte in a greater conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of working, and ſo thinke an impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:16777:282"/>
as eaſily shewed in man's actions as in the actions of anie other nature. For ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not we ſaie of manie things befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re they be donne, that no wiſe man will doe them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that who doth them is not wiſe. For example, can you thinke that anie wiſe man will take a ball to cut withall, or a pikestaffe to fetch water in? Be not ſuch things as theſes as eaſily knowne, as whether there be anie place without a bodie, or ſtuffed with more then one? Wherefore we may beſure that if a wiſe man goe to fetch water, he will take ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me thing elſe then a pikeſtaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe to fetch it in,<note place="margin">HoW reaſon come's to faile in anie man,</note> or if he be to cut, he will not take a balle; ſo that t'is manifeſt reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath as firme principles as anie other
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:16777:282"/>
nature, And that as the nature of one thing will hold vntill a ſtronger contrarie doe croſſe it, ſo there muſt be in anie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man a contrarie diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſtronger then reaſon in him, to make him goe againſt reaſon. Now therefore if you can caſt vp the force of reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of it's contraries, you may certainely know what a man will doe; which although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs you cannot exactly ballance in a particular man, yet in a great number and in whole multitudes you may in ſome things know it as certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely, as you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe anie thing by a demonſtration. For exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuppoſe there were an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of graue and wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as our Parlement or the like, which had had a verie faire

ſunne shyne day to fit on, And one should tell you that in the next ſeſſions following they would decree it had bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne a verie fowle day, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d would commande vnder paine of death euerie man to belieue and profeſſe foe. Which though I thinke you will ſaie it were impoſſible they should make anie ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, yet would I know how you would goe about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue it. Would your not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re what force of feares of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes were neceſſarie to induce one of theſe men to tell ſuch a notorious lye, whereby he were to hazard his conſcience and reputation for euer, and then increaſe and augment the difficultie by the multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de? And farther would you
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:16777:283"/>
not vrge that there were no ſuch hopes or feares as were able to quell anie one, or at leaſt a were neceſſarie to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaye them all, conſidering that the ſame hopes or feares could not falle vpon ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of eſtates and humours as all theſe men were of, And knowing certainely anie of theſe three you would aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly pronunce the ſuppoſed aſſertion to be falſe. For ſaie you, <hi>ſuch</hi> a force is neceſſarie to breake reaſon in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but <hi>ſuch</hi> a force at this preſent cannot be had, and therefore reaſon at this preſent cannot be broken in them. In which diſcourſe a Mathematician will tell you, his demonſtrations hang vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the verie ſame gimalls. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:16777:284"/>
as men cannot ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily demonſtrate, that one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die cannot bee in two places, nor two in one, yet are we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine there is a naturall demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration for it, and we are by nature aſſured of it. So no doubt, but there is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to him that liueth in London, that there is a Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bridge, and he is naturally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of it, though he cannot frame the demonſtration by articles and ſylogiſmes as a true philoſopher can doe, for ſurely a philoſopher, if he will take paines, may finde a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration for both.</p>

continued vnto our days; whereof our warrant is no other then that we finde the preſent church in quiet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, and whereof no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining is knowne, if this I ſaie you conſidere and ſticke well to this apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you neede not feare anie obiection which can be made againſt you. For you rely vpon the teſtimonie of the whole Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church, you rely vpon the force of nature borne to continue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> father to child, you rely vpon the promiſes of Ieſus Chriſt of continuing his church vnto the end of the world, And vpon the efficacitie of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſent to performe it, by whom Chriſt's law was written in Chriſtians harts and ſo to be continued to the day
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:16777:287"/>
of doome, So that you ſee no human authoritie, by which our Eſtates and liues are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned; No proofes of courts or law, which neuertheleſſe are admitted as Iuges of thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires which too manie (God knowe's) eſteeme more we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ightie and important then Religion, No conſent of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, And in fine (if what we haue ſaid be true) no demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration better, nor greater, nor peraduenture equall. On the other ſide you shall finde all obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fall of their owne weakneſſe. As, ſome doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the Millenarie errour for a tradition, whereof there is no certaintie, nor conſent of thoſe who write of it, whether it haue beene publickly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the Apoſtles or no,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:16777:287"/>
And euen thence it is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the nature of ſuch tradition as we rely vpon. Others finding diuers fathers agreeing in one opinion, vrge them preſently <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>againſt, tradition,</hi> As if fathers in their dayes were not priuat Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and might not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſome points as well as the Doctors of the preſent church, T'is true we reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the fathers in manie titles aboue anie liuing Doctors, yet euerie Catholike knowe's that diuers fathers haue ſome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes light into the ſame error. Wherefore you muſt note, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, that the fathers ſpeake ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me times as witneſes of what the church held in their days, and ſome times as Doctors, and ſo t'is often hard to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:16777:288"/>
how they deliuer their opinions, becauſe ſome times they preſſe ſcripture or raiſon as Doctors, and ſome times to confirme a knowne truth. So that who ſeeke's Tradition in the fathers and to conuince it by their teſtimonie, take's a hard taske vpon him, if he goe rigorouſly to worke and haue a conning Criticke to his Aduerſarie.

Wherefore although di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers fathers in the ſame or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ages be found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict ſome point, whereof the preſent church is in quiet and immemorable poſſeſſion, their authorities ought not to

preuaile; nor are they ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to proue there was not euen in their days a contrarie Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion.

                  <p>Marry I would deny it to be true, I meane I would ſaie that God's law was not forgotten, but neglected before the floud, And the like at the building of Babell; And for Abraham's time, we know that Abimelech, and Pharao, and Melchiſedech, and others (as Iob when ſoeuer he liued) obſerued God's law. As for heathen Religions they were written in bookes, for anie thing I know, and therefore preiudice <hi>tradition</hi> no more then a <hi>written law,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently belong not to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie. And thus I thinke I should quitte my ſelf wel enough.</p>

                  <p>Soone enough at leaſt, but let vs ſee if it be with as good ſpeede as much haſte. For ſuppoſe they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that the neglect of God's law muſt of neceſſitie breede obliuion, and therefore that ether God's law was forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or shortly would haue beene, if the punishement of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge had not preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it. And for the men you cite of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's time they were but few, and though in that time God's law had yet ſome litle force, looke but into Moſe's time and you shall ſee all ouerru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne with Idolatrie. For Heathen Religions t'is ſaid of the Drui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that their Ceremonies we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not written, but deliuered by memorie in verſe from the Elder to the yonger and ſo
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:16777:293"/>
conſerued; And the Hiſtories of the welch a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Irish ſeeme to haue beene conſerued in the like manner by the Bardes, which how full of fables they were euerie man knowe's. So that theſe things ſeeme ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to diſcredit <hi>Tradition.</hi>

                  <p>You tould me, the <hi>Tradition</hi> of Chriſtian faith was a great while a planting in

the harts of men by the force of miracles, and that not only in their vnderſtandings but alſo in their wills and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and ſo cultiuated vntill the maine of the people were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly perſuaded there was no ſaluation without it. This was done at the ſame time in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Countries, not knowing one of an other, nor being able to correſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and frame anie draught of beliefe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but euerie one receiuing what was deliuered him from his preacher.</p>

                  <p>As for Adam's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren I ſee that one man and
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:16777:294"/>
one woman were the only wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes of ſuch a thing as the partys to whom they tould it could hardly belieue, it was ſo ſtrange, Nay them ſelues had ſo litle experience of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſtrange things which they tould, that (for anie thing we know) they neuer as much as taſted of anie fruit in Paradiſe but of the forbidden tree, And what care they had of anie Religion more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de God's ſeruice to their children, and that only as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as they liued with them, we know not, ſo that it ſeeme's what they taught tooke no ſtrong roote, nor in manie. For Noth the ſame anſwere may be giuen, two of his ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes parting shortly from him ether into farr countries, or at
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:16777:294"/>
leaſt into ſuch a diſtance, as that they ſeldome came to ſee him, Wherefore I perceiue there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the deliuerie of Chriſt's Goſpell and of the law of God to thoſe fathers of the old Teſtament.</p>

                  <p>Your remarkes are good ones; And in deede ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue required that <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> should haue the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of nature, We muſt ſee that it be pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted accordingly, which you haue well noted to haue beene performed in Chriſt's law, but not in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ould law, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and people of that time being much hindered by the great buſines of the world's plantation, Euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeking to plant countries, build cities,
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:16777:295"/>
finde out commodities for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeruation of man's life, Which were occupations farr different from the thoughts of heauen, and things of the next world. To this you may add that there was not then anie ſetled orders of Prieſts and men whoſe fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be to inculcate the neceſſitie of Religion into men's eares and harts, which we knowe the Apoſtles had care to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me euerie where. Againe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re was no ſuch correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt countrie and countrie in thoſe times as hath euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene amongſt Chriſtians, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the mediation of a cheefe Bishop which Chriſt hath ſet amongſt vs. And no doubt but theſe two laſt points be two maine and cheefe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:16777:295"/>
of the propagation and conſeruation of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith. You may yet add that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the points of faith were not then able to worke vpon man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo powerfully as ſince Chriſt's comming, according to our yeſternight's diſcourſe. So that the roote and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of Tradition being grounded vpon this, that ſuch a beliefe is fixed in peoples harts of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the examples faile in three things. Firſt that the multitude was not capable of it, it being ſo ſpirituall and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract. Secondly that it was not inculcated with that feruour of ſpirit, aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, and abundance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall miracles, as Chriſt's law was. Thirdly that there was not a ſet forme and inſtitution
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:16777:296"/>
of Prieſts and Gouernors to ioyne all nations in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for the conſeruation of their beliefe. Wherefore it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had the roote and nature of an vniuerſall Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And by theſe examples you may eaſily anſwere all other obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this nature. And now I will leaue you leaſt I should ouer wearie both you and my ſelf.</p>

               <p>IT was firſt your intention to giue me a rule how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne my ſelf in the choiſe of Religion, Then you conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that ſcripture could not
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:16777:296"/>
be this rule, Where vpon you laid me downe two waies how to reſolue my ſelf. The firſt was that ſtanding vpon the ground of prepoſſeſſion there was no likelyhood or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie that the Proteſtants ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments could be ſufficient to ouer ballance the Catholikes, becauſe they muſt be conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing cleerely or else were to be reiected, And that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants should bring anie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing and demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtratiue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes there is no apparence, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes being more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in qualitie greater ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in life more vertuous; And on the contrarie ſide Proteſtants hauing no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de which may make them agree amongſt
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:16777:297"/>
themſelues. And you shewd me that though this perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not euidently conuince the Catholike faith to be true, yet did it manifeſtly proue that the Catholike was to be choſen by an vnlearned man. Your ſecond waye was by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a direct proofe that the Catholike doctrine is true, which you did in threeſeuerall manners. Firſt by shewing that it was no hard matter for the Catholike church to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the truth of hir doctrine, if she were carefull, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories plainely shew she was. Secondly shewing that nature doth force men to haue care of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therefore that it was impoſſible anie error should ſo creepe into the church as that it should be
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:16777:297"/>
vniuerſally receiued, the verie nature of man and human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires contradicting it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe. Thirdly, shewing how the church now relying vpon <hi>Tradition,</hi> muſt of neceſſitie haue euer done ſo, and that if it hath euer done ſo, it could not let anie falſehood creepe in, nor ſuffer anie error to be generally admitted. This is all I remember, ſauing the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of ſome obiections and the diſcouering of ſome of my impertinent anſweres, which I hope you will excuſe and forget. If I haue miſſed I pray direct me.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Vncle.</speaker>
                  <p>Yo haue taken good notice, and I thinke my pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes well beſtowed, only I would intreate you to make a litle reflection and compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:16777:298"/>
betwixt the knowledge which we haue by theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and that which ſcripture afforde's vs if we handle it in a litigious waye, as in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies we neceſſarily muſt. And you shall finde that Tradition is grounded vpon <hi>that</hi> which all men agree in, and vpon <hi>that</hi> which is common to all ages, all nations, all conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But the knowledge which we haue by ſcripture is grounded vpon <hi>that</hi> which is different in euerie nation. Hence ſpring's an other differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to wit, that the one is planted in nature, and in what God created in man: the other in what men them ſelues framed, and that not by deſigne or art, but by cuſtome and chance. Out of which againe enſueth that
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:16777:298"/>
the one is capable of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and conſequently of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect demonſtration, as all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things are, the other not. The one is fixed vpon vniuerſalls, the other vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonde in particulars. As for example who is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that a word in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie hath no other ſenſe then <hi>that</hi> which is neceſſarie for his pourpoſe? Or where the conſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be made diuers waies, that the true one is <hi>that</hi> which he pleadeth? Who can demonſtrate amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt varieties of texts which was in the Autograph? Or that the copies we haue are not defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue? And the like, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily are neceſſarie if we will euindently conuince our intent out of the place we cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſe.
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:16777:299"/>
On the other ſide, To shew that whole multitudes of ſeuerall nations cannot miſſe in what hath beene a thouſand times ouer a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ouer inculcated vnto them, That a world cannot conſpire to coſen their poſteritie, That mankinde cannot accepte of a doctrine againſt an euident principle, which they likewiſe hold and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine (theſe being the maximes Tradition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende's on) to shew, I ſaie, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe things there needes no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epe learning, being both knowne of them ſelues, and alſo as neceſſarily conioint and dependant of man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as his other naturall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be, and therefore may beare as good a demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they; which if we haue not,
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:16777:299"/>
it is not through anie defect or incapacitie of the ſubiect, but through the want of our looking into it, and that ether becauſe we doe not take the right waie, or that we doe not beſtow ſufficient paines in the proſecution of it. So that in fine although the Roman church had fallen (which is impoſſible) into thoſe errors which the Proteſtants prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, yet were it better for a man to content him ſelf with the Good that remaines in it, then to caſt him ſelf into an endleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and fruitleſſe maze of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations with trouble to all the world, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that to no other effect, then to make people vnſetled, and by their vnnſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſſe to neglect Religion. But God's wiſdome (as you
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:16777:300"/>
ſee) hath prouided an Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce for thoſe that will take pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to ſeeke it, 1. that the poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in controuerſie are of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and neceſſarie to be knowne, 2. that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſo knowne by ſcripture as is requiſite for deciſions againſt contentious men, and 3. that they may be certainely knowne by reſting quiet in the boſome of the Catholike church, which God of his mercie giue you and me gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to doe both liuing and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
